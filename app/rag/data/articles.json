The pair of tdawgg and XXiF came about in 2024 when both joined QoR to compete in NA Challengers. QoR placed in the top eight of Split 1 , but missed the playoffs of Split 2 , ending the team's chance for Ascension. After their elimination, tdawgg and XXiF opted not to re-sign with the organization for 2025. TSM, after a trip to Ascension, brought in the QoR duo as they rebuilt their roster for Split 3 of Challengers. This new roster played in two tournaments together. They emerged victorious at For Those Who Dare 2024 , an invitational featuring 100 Thieves , and then placed in the top eight of Challengers Split 3. tdawgg has clarified that he was not dropped by TSM, but left in order to pursue an offer from a different team. No statement has been made thus far from XXiF. TSM will need to re-complete their roster before Stage 1 of Challengers 2025, starting on Jan 29.

Global Esports owner Rushindra Sinha confirmed to vlr.gg that Deryeon will be playing in place of Mark \" yokam \" Musni , whose visa has been delayed. Deryeon is best known for his time on BLEED , one of the top Singaporean teams in Challengers. He joined the organization in late 2021, and led the team to consistent top-three finishes throughout 2022, including the APAC Last Chance Qualifier . The beginning of the VCT partnership league in 2023 gave BLEED free rein to dominate Challengers, capped off with an Ascension win at the end of the season. The following year was not as successful for BLEED, as the team struggled during both Kickoff and the regular season. By August, BLEED had benched four players , including Deryeon. In November, Deryeon joined Disguised , helping the team win three off-season events, and was among the ten highest-rated players in Challengers Southeast Asia Stage 3.

Colin \" coconut \" Patrick Chung (钟弘祖) , who had been on the team's roster for offseason tournaments, was also signed permanently. Viva is no stranger to Challengers teams. He spent the 2023 team on Rare Atom , and reached the grand final of Ascension China where they lost to Dragon Ranger Gaming . Following that, he was picked up by JDG Esports as part of a four-man Rare Atom signing class. Over the course of the last two seasons, Viva's in-game role has remained relatively the same. With Rare Atom, he handled the duelist duties on Jett and Iso while also logging time as Sova and Viper. This continued with JDG in 2024, though his minutes as a duelist significantly decreased. In 2024, Xi Lai Gaming defeated a new-look Rare Atom in the grand final of Ascension China , avenging two previous defeats in the competition against them to earn themselves a spot as China's 12th VCT team. Following the win, they parted ways with in-game leader Kr1stal due to the team having more than one non-resident player. XLG has been one of the busier players in the Chinese offseason window, dropping coach Fayde for new assistant ANXiOS and picking up players YOU , ZiXuan , and coconut . The ripple effect following roster movement from other Chinese VCT teams such as TYLOO and the aforementioned JDG has reached Xi Lai. They parted ways with MrCANI , who was a part of their Ascension-winning five-man core, and have now signed Viva. Ahead of their debut season in the VCT, Xi Lai have impressed at OFF//SEASON events. Top-four finishes at WALL-E Cup and FGC Invitational preceded their Superb Cup win, which saw them defeat world champions EDward Gaming .

Viva joined JDG in January 2024 as part of a four-man signing class from Rare Atom . The pickups came following Rare Atom's 2023 run to the Ascension China grand finals, where they lost to Dragon Ranger Gaming . With Rare Atom, Viva played a multitude of roles, including Jett, Iso, Sova, and Viper. This role continued with JDG in 2024, though he played considerably fewer games as a duelist. MrCANI joins after being released by Xi Lai Gaming , with whom he'd spent the entire 2024 season. After winning Ascension China with them, he was a part of Xi Lai's late offseason roster moves. He was mainly XLG's initiator player, though he occasionally filled in to play the controller role on Omen. JDG will be his fourth team in three seasons. Babyblue joins with plenty of tier-two experience. He comes from ZY Gaming , and was also previously signed to Wolves Esports , but did not see the stage for them. Throughout his career, he's mainly been used in the duelist and initiator roles. JDG's 2024 season saw them finish top six at the end of Stage 2 , missing out on reaching any international events. Since the end of their season, they've participated in three OFF//SEASON events, and have made a handful of personnel changes. They signed EGO and hypnotizing as their coaching duo, while also adding in-game leader sword9 . All three joined from All Gamers . Weeks later, they parted ways with hypnotizing and sword9, then dropped Viva and signed MrCANI.

Following their brief stint on JDG Esports , sword9 and hypnotizing have joined TYLOO as the team's head coach and coach , respectively. The pair replaces slk and Sunshine, who were released last week . For long-time viewers of the Chinese circuit, sword9 is known for playing with KONE eSports Club , the second-best team in the region at the time. With KONE, sword9 qualified to the 2022 East Asia LCQ , where the team ended in the top four after losing to finalists Incheon OnSla2ers. After KONE disbanded in 2023, sword9 joined EDward Gaming as assistant coach. While there, the team reached Masters Tokyo and Champions 2023 . He left EDG in early 2024 to join All Gamers as in-game leader. Coach hypnotizing joined later in the season to reinforce AG's staff. The team had middling results, qualifying to both Stage playoffs with a 5-5 record but failing to advance past the single-elimination matches. In October, JDG Esports picked up sword9 as IGL and hypnotizing as assistant coach. Unfortunately, JDG was unsuccessful during the off-season, only winning two games across three events. TYLOO later announced the arrival of assistant coach Billyo . He was known for his time on FunPlus Phoenix , which he helped coached between 2022-2023, and was able to qualify to LOCK//IN ater an upset win against EDward Gaming . He next joined Bilibili Gaming , but departed for a head cosch role at JDG Esports after two months. He remained on the team through the rest of 2023, and was the only team member to stay after JDG picked up Rare Atom for the inaugural VCT China season.

    "cleaned_content": "“It was definitely a lot of extra grinding, but I think it was worth it.” Nearly two weeks ago, 2024 EMEA Ascension champions Apeks became the first organization to sign a Game Changers competitor straight to Tier 1. Ava \" florescent \" Eugene of Shopify Rebellion Gold secured a reappearance at Berlin's Riot Games Arena this upcoming year, albeit in a completely different league. In an exclusive interview with VLR.gg, florescent shared her reflections on both past and present endeavors, highlighting her journey up to this point in time. The prodigy's path to pro started many years ago in the form of a small monthly tournament. “My first tournament was a Sakura Cup , an NA Monthly Game Changers tournament. I don't think it had an age restriction, because I was 14, so I just played with friends for fun.” Two monthly Game Changers tournaments made up the entirety of florescent's 2021 as recorded on VLR. However, her break into a more competitive environment took the shape of Misfits Black , the first organization she signed with. “Around that time was when I realized that I wanted to take this super seriously and focus more on playing Valorant [in general].” And play Valorant she did. Following her stay with Misfits, florescent would go on to sign with the now-Shopify Rebellion roster, vaulting her even further up the competitive ladder as she trained with the top players of Game Changers. Even heading into the 2023 Game Changers Championship, her performance did not falter, as she and the rest of Shopify claimed the organization's first GCC trophy following an undefeated run throughout the upper bracket. However, the job wasn't quite done for the coronated monarchs of Game Changers. The first international trophy florescent and Shopify hoisted. (Photo: Adela Sznajder/Riot Games) The new year meant new challenges and competition for most, but not for florescent and Shopify. The team won all three series of NA Game Changers and secured yet another appearance at this year's GCC. By this time, however, florescent's performance had finally caught the attention of organizations outside of Game Changers. “[Apeks] reached out during [Series 3]... and we organized for me to fly into Berlin earlier than my teammates so I could trial. It went pretty well… I thought I would make it off the trials. I thought I did pretty good. I didn't know how well the other people at trials did, but just for myself, I was pretty confident going into it.” Throughout her time in Berlin – which once again ended with yet another trophy for the talent alongside an MVP award – florescent's path to Tier 1 was finally solidifying through her performance in trials. Shortly after her second victory on an international stage, Apeks officially announced her signing. “I was definitely excited. I remember telling my team when it happened.” However, signing with Apeks meant leaving behind not just her teammates but competing in Game Changers. Despite this, Shopify's former star had nothing but good things to say about her stay within the scene. “It was definitely really positive, I [didn't] really have any bad experiences. I feel like I've gotten to know a lot of people and made a lot of friends. I'm pretty grateful.” florescent's signing with Apeks ended a two-year stint with meL and the rest of the rebels. (Photo: Adela Sznajder/Riot Games) Her new environment didn't seem to faze the newly-signed talent at all, either. Even making the jump from North America to EMEA for more than just a brief tournament seemed almost insignificant to florescent. “When I turned 16 I moved all the way across Canada for better ping and I didn't have any family there, so I think it'll be fine. My teammates are all nice and helpful so I feel like I won't have many problems there. I know some people in Berlin just from VCT, so I'm not too worried about that.” The shift in attitude also felt miniscule to the competitor, who confirmed the hard work that players across all scenes put into improving themselves. “I didn't really notice that much, it doesn't feel too different to me. At the end of the day everyone's just trying to win.” The rest of Apeks meshed very well with florescent, as she recalled past practices the team underwent ahead of their debut in the EMEA League. “We all get together really well. Everyone is really funny. We just had a two-week bootcamp in Serbia and it wasn't the best of circumstances for some days, but we all had a good time. I think everyone likes each other.” “We've just been grinding. We have the least amount of time compared to all the other teams since I had the GC schedule going on. I'm in NA right now, and we're working on getting our fifth fully confirmed. We just have to grind, really, that's all it is. During the bootcamp we were practicing really hard, working on everything that we could.” New to Tier 1 but not new to winning, florescent stayed confident when asked about the teams within the EMEA League, her new competition for the year. “I'm always confident. I never want to say that I think we're gonna lose or I think we'll do ok. I'm super confident. It's gonna be fun. I'm really excited, honestly.” While on the topic of teams she would want to play, the new pickup struggled to choose. “Maybe FNATIC , because I like Chronicle and Boaster a lot. I'm trying to think of the teams in the EMEA. Maybe Karmine Corp because I like saadhak .” As for teams that would be tough to play against, it was no surprise to any that last year's Champions runner-ups were first to be named. “[A tough team] this early would probably be Team Heretics because they kept the same roster and they have so much experience playing together. Right now, Team Vitality is not the strongest because even if they have a super good roster on paper they just need a little more time. Heretics… they play good together, so I think they'll be pretty exciting to play against if we get to.” Making the jump from Game Changers to Tier 1 was no small feat, and although the change in competition brought on new challenges, florescent still had goals for herself throughout the year in hopes of improving even more than she already has. “I just want to be able to play confidently and be comfortable playing with my teammates, especially because I'm just starting to get to know them more now. I just want to have fun really.” New challenges are what the two-time MVP strives for this year. (Photo: Adela Sznajder/Riot Games) Finally, when asked about advice for not just aspiring Game Changers players but all those aiming to go pro, the two-time World Champion responded with what brought her from humble beginnings to the grandest of stages. “Just grind hard, be a nice person, and sometimes you'll have to work extra, extra hard, way after everyone. Come in early, bring your stuff, just work your hardest and don't be an asshole. Can I swear? Just be a good person to others. Even if you don't reach your goals, if you leave a good impression on people, you'll be fine.” Apeks have yet to officially sign a fifth player and will debut against a rebuilt Gentle Mates in their first match of the EMEA League, which is set to kick off on Jan 16. Despite the world watching, florescent will continue to play her own game confidently, eager for each and every challenge."

The event will have a 12 team, double-elimination bracket, with the best performing 2024 VCT teams earning a bye into the second round. The top two teams will qualify to Masters Bangkok and earn Championship Points, while the teams that round out the top four will earn 1 Championship Point. This year, two teams will qualify to Champions Paris off of Championship Points , further rewarding year-long consistency. Currently, specific times and dates are still to be announced, and the specific order of the matches is not final. Kickoff 2025 will feature 12 teams in a double-elimation bracket (Picture by VALORANT Esports CN) Xi Lai Gaming vs Wolves Esports The region's newest team, Xi Lai Gaming , will play against Wolves Esports , the most successful Chinese team in the off-season. Both teams went through roster moves after the 2024 circuit, with Wolves opting for a rebuild due to a 4-6 regular season and XLG needing to make changes due to the import rule and Wolves acquiring assistant coach Fayde . After the roster changes, the teams faced off against each other three times in the off-season, twice in a best-of-five. Wolves came out on top with three wins, including a 3-0 in the Shanghai Esports Masters grand final . The winner of this series will then play against Bilibili Gaming , who received a bye after qualifying to Champions 2024 on championship points. TYLOO vs Titan Esports Club The bracket will next pit two teams that failed to reach a playoff stage last year against each other. TYLOO ended the 2024 regular season with a 4-6 record, while Titan Esports Club remained at the bottom of the table, only winning three matches in the league and five total in an official series. The teams used most of their off-season experimenting, playing with different lineups in an effort to identify their best approach for the upcoming season. They did not show results, however, as they ended towards the bottom in the off-season tournaments they played. In terms of roster changes, on paper, TEC had a more flashy pickup , however, signing former EDward Gaming in-game leader Haodong and coach AfteR . The winner of the series will play against FunPlus Phoenix , the second best VCT CN team in 2024. JDG Esports vs Dragon Ranger Gaming Dragon Ranger Gaming will play against JDG Esports in their opening series. The teams played against each other only once last year, but the cores are familiar with each other, having been protagonists (with JDG's stew and Viva then playing under Rare Atom ) of the final leg of the 2023 Ascension tournament and T2 circuit. Both teams had middling success in 2024, with DRG reaching the top four in Kickoff and Stage 1, qualifying to Masters Shanghai , but JDG ending the year with a slightly better league record and attending the end-of-year playoffs. The teams had similar, if disappointing, results in the off-season, failing to make waves in the events they attended. Trace Esports awaits them in the next round, a team that ended 2024 as a top three team in the region and reached third place in the Valorant Radiant Asia Invitational after defeating Gen.G and DRX. All Gamers vs Nova Esports Rounding out the opening matches, All Gamers will face off against Nova Esports . The teams played each other recently in the off-season, with Nova Esports coming out on top twice. In terms of results, Nova has had a better off-season than All Gamers , reaching two finals and defeating teams such as EDG, Wolves, and Trace, while AG has only taken wins against TYLOO and JDG. That said, All Gamers has played with a different lineup in each tournament, so those results will not necessarily reflect the actual performance of the team. The team that comes out on top will need to play against EDward Gaming , the current world Champions , if they wish to remain in the upper bracket. Kickoff China will begin on January 11 (Beijing time, exact schedule to be determined), with the event's finalist qualifying to Masters Bangkok."

Those teams received a bye from the first round, qualifying for the upper bracket's quarterfinals. The second pool has the region's remaining eight teams, which were drawn against each other with the winners facing teams from the first pool. The 2025 Pacific Kickoff bracket. (Photo by Riot Games) With two new organizations and a slew of roster moves between teams, the first round brings a handful of interesting matchups. BOOM Esports vs. T1 Two months ago, BOOM lost in the grand final of Pacific Ascension finishing their 2024 season as coming close, but not close enough to reaching VCT. Following Riot's decision to remove BLEED , BOOM earned their spot as the Pacific region's 12th team. Their first test at the top level of Valorant will be against T1, who this offseason have bolstered their ranks with the signings of Meteor , BuZz , and Sylvan . The winner of this match will go on to play last year's Stage 1 champions, Paper Rex . Global Esports vs. Team Secret Team Secret enjoyed a quietly successful 2024 season, finishing with an overall record of 10-7. They were third at the end of Stage 2 , but were eliminated in the knockout stage of the playoffs. While Team Secret was in the middle of the Pacific pack, Global Esports had a 2024 to forget. They registered just four wins on the season and ended Stage 2 with just three wins without any playoff appearances. They have since revamped their team, bringing in a new five-man roster. Three of their new signees are from the Phillippines and will make their GE debuts against the Phillippines-based Team Secret. The winner will go on to face TALON . Rex Regum Qeon vs. DetonatioN FocusMe Rex Regum Qeon had a solid 2024 as one of the teams in the middle of the pack. While they missed out on the Stage 1 playoffs, a better Stage 2 got them into the playoffs, where they were eliminated in the knockouts. They have had a quieter offseason, making just one personnel change while making short-lived appearances at Red Bull Home Ground and the Radiant Asia Invitational . They will take on a DFM team that has had anything but a quiet offseason. Widespread changes saw them pick up four new players, building around Duelist player Meiy . After shaking off some rust at Red Bull Home Ground, they impressed at the Radiant Asia Invitational, reaching the grand final and falling to Paper Rex. Awaiting the winner of the two teams is the Masters Shanghai champions, Gen.G ZETA DIVISION vs. Nongshim RedForce ZETA's offseason began with the retirement of longtime player Laz . After qualifying for Champions 2023 through the Pacific LCQ , they failed to reach a single global event in 2024. They picked up a trio of players and a new head coach from tier 2 side FENNEL , and have shown some improvement. They reached the grand final of Red Bull Home Ground, falling to T1. Nongshim Redforce, previously known as Sin Prisa Gaming before they were acquired , enter their maiden season in VCT after winning Pacific Ascension. The five players and head coach from SPG remain together, while NongShim's second-tier squad disbanded following Split 3 of Challengers Korea , which they won. Korean giants DRX , who have undergone a major offseason rebuild themselves, await the winner. At least year's Pacific Kickoff, which was held with a three-group format that ended with a four-team single-elimination bracket, Gen.G put themselves on the map. After qualifying for the playoffs through the play-in, they swiftly defeated perennial powerhouses DRX and Paper Rex, marking their first competition victory in what went down as a successful 2024 for them.

    "cleaned_content": "NRG has overcome Gen.G 3-0 in the grand final of the SOOP Valorant League , earning the right to lift the trophy in one of the biggest events of the offseason. The three-map series played out on Abyss, Haven, and Ascent, Abyss and Ascent being Gen.G's picks and Haven being NRG's pick. NRG won Abyss 13-4, Haven 13-11, and Ascent 13-4. Both teams came into this match with a point to prove. For NRG, it was a chance to turn over a new leaf for an experienced core after a disappointing 2024 season with the addition of two highly anticipated rookies. For Gen.G, it was a chance to show that changing two players hadn't taken away from their ability to vie for championships. A fresh opportunity for three Americas veterans. (Photo by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games) The series kicked off on Gen.G's first map pick of Abyss . Both sides brought out distinct compositions that they had shown earlier in the event, with Gen.G locking in Astra and Omen and NRG opting for Harbor and Vyse. The first six rounds were back-and-forth, leading to a 3-3 start, but NRG tore away with a 9-3 lead as Gen.G became increasingly unable to handle the opposition's rapid site hits, ironclad postplants, and deep mid searches. In the second half, NRG demonstrated a superior defense with impressive and varied Vyse setups from FiNESSE , easily closing out Abyss 13-4. Statistically, it was Verno and s0m who controlled the server; the former found 17 kills to 6 deaths and a 1.66 rating while the latter scored 18 kills to 9 deaths and a 1.49 rating. NRG opened their map pick of Haven with a similarly dominant attack half, building an 8-4 lead despite losing the first pistol. In contrast, the second half was neck-and-neck as both teams struggled to string together multiple rounds in a row until the score was 12-8 in NRG's favor. Gen.G rallied temporarily, managing to get to 11 rounds, but NRG denied overtime and won out Haven 13-11. While Munchkin led his team with 19 kills and a 1.13 rating, it was Verno once again lighting up the scoreboard with 21 kills to only 11 deaths and a 1.67 rating. The American Initiator racked up highlights on the map, including a 1v2 in round 11 and a belting 4K with the Guardian in round 15. The final map was Ascent . This time, NRG established an even greater lead early on, converting the first pistol on their defense and then the bonus off the back of a Judge 3K from s0m. An ace from s0m in round 7 later led his team to a 6-1 lead. Every setup that NRG used seemed to work perfectly to foil Gen.G's plans as they consistently won out their duels, culminating in a 10-2 half. NRG took home Ascent 13-4 to complete the clean sweep over Gen.G and win the SOOP League. “I think we just had a really good flow in all three maps, we had a good game plan going into the game,” FiNESSE commented on the win in the post-match interview. “I think it showed that we're pretty good, so hopefully a lot of winning next season,” Ethan added when asked what fans could expect from the team going into 2025. With this win, NRG has cemented themselves as a title contender going into the 2025 season, which is now just one month away. NRG will next return for Americas Kickoff , which begins Jan. 16."

DRX ends the tournament in the top four, reaching playoffs after defeating Bilibili Gaming and Rapid Lofi in groups. This series is the tenth time both teams play each other, with eight of those matches taking place this year. Overall, DRX had the upper hand with five wins prior to this encounter, but Gen.G boasts a much better record when counting only VCT matches — four wins and two losses. Gen.G opened their map, Pearl , with t3xture taking over to win the pistol. He kept the pace up, leading his team to a six round winstreak. By round five, he had 13 eliminations, which set him up to finish the attack with a 1.54 rating. Eventually, DRX took their first round win, courtesy of HYUNMIN 's Neon, but Gen.G quickly adapted, reaching double digits in the first half with ease. Karon stuck the defuse to secure the pistol, all but confirming a win on the first map. Foxy9 found a 3K on B long to overtake t3xture as top fragger, taking his team to match point. Gen.G opted to play the bonus cautiously, but it still came down to the wire, as MaKo needed to win a 1v1 for DRX's third round. Now with a full buy, Gen.G was better able to control the final round, and Karon came out on top over MaKo in the Astra mirror, taking the 1v1 and sealing Pearl 13-3. Gen.G executed a successful retake to win the first pistol round on Bind , DRX's selection. Their gun advantage let them win a second retake, but DRX's Neon-led double-sentinel composition applied enough pressure to put them in the lead. Gen.G tied the score at 3-3, but Hyunmin and Flashback helped their team stay ahead during the remainder of the half. Together, the duo found 7 first kills, while the entirety of Gen.G combined only had 5. free1ng showed up on round 10, finding a 3K with the round ended by Flashback in a 1v1. Munchkin earned a fourth point for his team after a 4K on B short, but was left in a 1v3 the next round after DRX's sentinel duo broke through Gen.G's defense. He was unable to clutch, which ended the half 8-4 in DRX's favor. A Karon 3K helped Gen.G recover, narrowing the score gap with a pistol win. He showed off his Marshall skills in the anti-eco, and t3xture helped Gen.G take the next two rounds to tie the score. DRX's stalling abilities rewarded them with a ninth point, but Gen.G played the map well, drew out DRX's resources, and took advantage of their ultimate economy to continue scoring rounds. t3xture took up an attack Operator to break through DRX, finding three with the premium weapon and another with his Showstopper. With his bullet just milliseconds ahead of the sniper shot, yoman denied t3xture the ace, ending Bind 13-9 and sending DRX home. Foxy9 mentioned conflicted feelings on defeating his former team. “I feel really happy, but it's a mix of emotions,” he said after the series. Despite this, he was confident in Gen.G. “My teammates have so much more potential than what we displayed today,” he said. “The team has helped me a lot, helped me grow.” “It's going to be a 3-0. 13-8 first map, 13-5 second map, 13-3 third map. All clean games from Gen.G,” he said regarding their grand final match."

NRG will next play against either DRX or Gen.G in the grand final , their second grand final this off-season. MiTH has been eliminated from the tournament, going out in the top four after taking wins against Sentinels and Talon Esports . The match began on Haven , with Verno cleaning up the pistol and anti-eco rounds to open the map. Three separate 4Ks followed, with MiTH getting on the board thanks to cgrs and Laz , while Verno remained on the killfeed to grant his team a tie at 3-3. He continued being key to his team's success, setting up a post-plant that returned NRG to the lead. MiTH's retakes put them up 5-4, but NRG quickly equalized following a timeout. The half remained close, ending with a tied score ahead of the break. A quick pistol round went MiTH's way, and they were able to win a 3v5 to slow the back-and-forth down and remain in the lead. The North American squad's economy forced them onto a semi-eco and a pair of half-buys, letting MiTH reach match point despite NRG closing the score gap. A tactical pause from MiTH led to a comfortable final round, ending the map 13-10 and marking MiTH's fifth map win against a VCT partnership team in this tournament. MiTH opened their map pick, Pearl , with a pistol round win. A close bonus round went NRG's way, but Kadoom extended his team's lead with a collateral Operator kill. NRG continued testing A after a timeout, closing the gap and leading to MiTH's own pause after an eco round. Undeterred, Kadoom and Killua helped put MiTH back in the lead, ending the half 7-5. NRG averted a potential disaster with a pistol win, seemingly more comfortable on the defense. They took the lead in the bonus round, and MiTH's low economy helped NRG set the score 9-7 and force a timeout from their opponents. mada opened the following round to help his team reach double digits, but cgrs countered by stopping a nearly-successful NRG retake. His efforts were not enough, however, as a Verno 3K forced MiTH into an eco-round. NRG reached match point, but was denied twice by their opponents. In the end, Ethan and FiNESSE led a retake to convert a 3v3, ending the map 13-10 and sending the series to a decider. Heading into the decider, Ascent , NRG was unstoppable. The NA team took the pistol after a retake, and was able to confirm a close bonus round by denying info to MiTH's remaining players. A flawless anti-eco prompted MiTH's first timeout of the decider, which in turn helped the Thai lineup win their first point. NRG remained confident, however, winning the next three rounds and forcing out MiTH's second pause at 7-1. MiTH was unable to find a gap in the defense until round 11, with cgrs and Kadoom shutting down NRG's retake attempt. NRG recovered quickly once again, as Ethan held an advanced position to catch MiTH's A push off-guard. MiTH kept their hopes up in the second half with a pistol win, but NRG punished an over-eager defense to take the bonus. Another patient attack put NRG at match point, and Ethan helped seal the decider 13-5 with a triple kill. Ethan was optimistic about his team's performance. “[It was a] slow start, but everyone's playing really well,” he said after the series. “The comms were good. “ “Everyone is getting used to each other,” he added. “We're getting to know what everyone likes to do. We're meshing pretty well.” He also commented on the grand final matchup. “We're excited to play a Korean team. DRX is a little more flashy, Gen.G is really good.”"

The competition's group stage mirrors the group stage used at Champions Seoul, arranging teams in groups of four with matches to be played in a double-elimination tournament. With powerhouse teams from North America, China, the host nation South Korea, and qualified teams from Thailand and Vietnam, the group stage was filled with tight matches, upsets, and the birth of a Cinderella story. Meet Made in Thailand, the Group A Cinderellas. (Photo by SOOP ) Group A winners: Made in Thailand & Gen.G Eliminated: Sentinels & TALON Made in Thailand earned their way into SOOP by winning the Thailand Qualifier , beating out second-tier teams like XERXIA Esports and FULL SENSE while defeating Team NKT Academy in a five-map grand final. They turned heads with a 2-1 victory over fellow Thai team TALON , but topped that performance with a 2-1 upset over American giants Sentinels . On the all-decisive third map, they fought back from down 12-6 to tough out a 17-15 victory. With Killua and former Paper Rex stand-in cgrs impressing through two wins, they finished the group stage as Group A's top seed. After being placed in another double-elimination group with Sentinels, Gen.G got the better of their overseas rivals in the SOOP Colosseum. After losing to them in two maps to open the event and then making quick work of TALON, they bounced back to avenge themselves against Sentinels, winning in two maps by a difference of five total rounds. t3xture had a match to remember in the rematch, dropping a server-high 47 kills with a rating of 1.26. He is part of a three-man returning class for the Masters Shanghai winners, who seem to have finally hit their stride with two new players. With no more OFF//SEASON events on their calendars, Sentinels and TALON have just around a month to prepare for the start of their respective region's Kickoff tournaments after being eliminated. Sentinels, who reloaded their roster with bang and N4RRATE , appear to still be troubleshooting the fine details of their team. Meanwhile, an impressive showing from rising star duelist primmie , who recorded 65 kills in the team's loss to Made in Thailand, was not enough to keep TALON alive.

Continued positive performances from Flashback on Cypher elevated the performance of DRX. He finished as the highest-fragging player in both matches with 20 more kills than deaths in both. DRX lost BuZz and Foxy9 to other Korean teams to start their offseason, and before SOOP, experienced inconsistent performances at the TEN Asia Invitational and the Radiant Asia Invitational . They move on to the playoffs as Group B's top seed, and will play Group B's second seed, Gen.G. After a shock upset to Rapid Lofi put them on the brink of elimination, NRG fought their demons of the past, defeating BiliBili Gaming in three maps. That victory set up a rematch with Rapid Lofi, one that they handled with much more ease than in the opening match. Despite struggles in pistol rounds, which at times put them at an early disadvantage, NRG ultimately prevailed. Namely, the play of new addition Verno , who ended the decider match with a server-high 38 kills, lifted the team. BiliBili Gaming failed to replicate their Champions Los Angeles success against NRG. Despite keeping both of their matches relatively competitive, they ultimately fell in three maps against NRG and DRX. Meanwhile, Rapid Lofi leaves SOOP at around the level that may have been expected of a Challengers squad, despite early hype after their win over NRG. Playoffs And then there were four. (Photo by SOOP ) The playoffs will be single-elimination, with the semifinals best-of-three and the grand final a best-of-five. With the top-seed of the groups paired with the second-seeds, the first-round matchups are: DRX vs. Gen.G The derby between Korean giants isn't quite the same as it was during the 2024 season. In Pacific play, Gen.G had the upper hand over DRX, winning four matches and dropping just one. In offseason events, DRX has gotten the better of Gen.G in both meetings. This match will be the last time that former Foxy9 will play his former team before the official season begins. Made in Thailand vs. NRG After turning heads in the group stage, Made in Thailand has a chance to cause more chaos, being matched up with NRG Esports. While the Thailand Challengers team may be new to many, one face is sure to be familiar to hardcore NRG fans: cgrs. Most known for his play on Gekko and Sova, he's iconic for his stand-in run at Masters Tokyo , which included an iconic win over a certain NRG."

    "cleaned_content": "Riot has revealed the matchups for the upcoming VCT 2025 EMEA Kickoff as well as important changes to formats for Challengers, Ascension, Game Changers, and Premier. Kickoff Similar to the format used in the Americas 2025 Kickoff , EMEA's Kickoff will utilize a 12-team double-elimination bracket to determine which two teams will represent the region at Masters Bangkok . Each team's position on the bracket was drawn at random in the Kickoff Draw Show , and the four teams who represented the EMEA region at last year's Champions received a BYE for their efforts. Game days will typically take place weekly on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays while Playoff games will occur on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Changes in the schedule can be expected for some of the “bigger moments in the season.” The EMEA Kickoff Bracket. (Image: Riot Games) A revamped Championship Point distribution system ensures each stage of competition holds high stakes and diminishes the chances of a team's season ending early into the year. The top four finishers of Kickoff will receive Championship Points for their troubles. Additionally, the playoffs of Stage 1 and Stage 2 will expand to eight teams rather than six. Challengers Riot has also released information regarding the state of EMEA Challengers this year, with many changes promoting a healthier Tier 2 ecosystem and path to Ascension. Earlier this year, Riot unveiled a revamped format for the EMEA Challengers across all leagues, which began with a 3-Stage competition that allowed for teams to garner Ascension Points. Tournament organizers now have greater flexibility designing split formats, ensuring diversity across all Challengers EMEA competition. The main focus, however, is the new format regarding the top two teams from the DACH, French, Spanish, and Turkish leagues. These eight teams will be joined by four teams from the NORTH//EAST region in a week-long competition. Featuring four matches a day in a round robin stage, the top four teams across four groups will advance to playoffs for their hearty share of Ascension Points. This process will be repeated for Stages 1 and 2, while Stage 3 will introduce another two teams from the MENA region. Regional playoffs outside of the main Challengers EMEA events will distribute less points that will increase with each stage. The dates for all three cross-Challengers League Tournaments can be found below: Challengers EMEA 1: March 3-9 Challengers EMEA 2: May 19-25 Challengers EMEA 3: Sep 1-9 Teams can earn Ascension Points by competing in their respective leagues as well as EMEA Challengers. (Image: Riot Games) Ascension While the main details of Ascension's format have yet to be released, Riot has clarified that the entire tournament will take place on LAN using a double-elimination format. Additionally, the winner of Stage 3 EMEA Challengers will receive a direct invite to Ascension, while all other teams attending will be based on Ascension Points. More details regarding Ascension will be released in 2025. Game Changers While the format for Game Changers will stay the same, Riot is introducing one change to spice up the competition and allow teams to play more games. The top ten teams will compete in one group rather than split across two, increasing the amount of games per Group Stage by over 20. Premier & Regional Circuits Finally, Premier will continue to serve as a “developmental proving ground” for players on their path to pro in 2025. However, the best amateur teams will be provided their own tournaments, with more details being shared closer to the event dates. The new EMEA format across all levels of competition has been readjusted to garner growth and development for players and teams. More games, attention, and higher stakes seem to be on the agenda for not just EMEA this year. EMEA Kickoff will begin on Jan 15 as teams fight for two tickets to the first Masters event of the year."

Going into the 2023 season, he joined NRG along with many other members of that core. The roster continued to be a leader in North America, placing fourth at Masters Tokyo , but suffered an unexpected group stage exit at Champions 2023 in Los Angeles. Despite this, expectations rose even higher for NRG in 2024 as they added world champions Max \" Demon1 \" Mazanov and Ethan \" Ethan \" Arnold . The superstar roster would face numerous challenges meeting those expectations, undergoing multiple roster changes, ending the Americas regular season with a 4-6 record, and ultimately failing to qualify for all three international events. crashies parted ways with the team in September. On the other side of the Atlantic, FNATIC faced similarly high expectations coming into 2024 after conquering LOCK//IN and Masters Tokyo in 2023. While still a top team in EMEA, the team struggled to match their previous heights this year as their best international result was a top-six finish at Champions 2024 . “Really happy to have Austin join for 2025 and I know his veteran leadership and mid-rounding will be a huge help to us going into the new season,” CoJo commented .

Oderus joins Apeks for the second coaching stint of his career. His first time as coach came under Moist Moguls , a role he kept for nearly a year. Under oderus, Moist Moguls debuted as a top tier 2 team in North America — even winning one of the two Splits of the 2023 Challenger League in the region — but failed to reach VCT competitions. He returned to the server earlier in February, now under the Moist x Shopify banner, but the team struggled to keep up last year's performance. The team peaked in the first half of the year, during which they won Split 1 of the Challenger League and finished inside the top four at the Mid Season Cup . Apeks followed a similar path in 2023, claiming a place atop EMEA's tier 2 but failing to reach VCT. The team avenged themselves with a stellar run this year where, much like their 2023 run, they only lost twice. Apeks capped the regular season off with a 3-2 victory over PCIFIC Esports in the grand finals of Ascension , securing their spot in the VCT EMEA 2025. Since lifting that trophy, Apeks have made several changes to their roster. Players Kajetan \" kaajak \" Haremski and Dom \" soulcas \" Sulcas left the team , as did assistant coach Casper \" Desmo \" Rasmussen . To fill kaajak's duelist slot, the organization became the first to sign a Game Changers player, when they announced two-time GC champion Ava \" florescent \" Eugene just days ago. With florescent and oderus' signings, the team has largely rebuilt itself for the 2025 season. With a new duelist and coach signed, the team lacks just a flex player to fill the shoes of soulcas, who departed for KOI . The VCT EMEA 2025 will be the largest the region has seen since the start of partnership.

The first pool had all four teams from the region that made Champions 2024 . Those teams received a bye from the first round, automatically qualifying for the upper bracket's quarterfinals. The second pool had the region's remaining eight teams. The teams were drawn against each other in the opening round, with winners facing teams from Pool 1. The 2025 Americas Kickoff bracket. (Photo by Riot Games) The draw brings forward a few interesting matchups, from cross-country rivalries to former international foes duking it out. Evil Geniuses vs. LOUD The two teams, who famously clashed in a five-map, lower final at Champions 2023 , will butt heads to open their respective 2025 seasons. Both rosters have an almost entirely new look. While tuyz and cauanzin remain from LOUD's 2023 team, Evil Geniuses has an entirely new five, with head coach potter the only constant since then. They will play for the chance to face KRÜ Esports . MIBR vs. 100 Thieves MIBR underwent possibly the biggest rebuild of the 2024 offseason, letting go of all but one player and constructing a new roster centered around Brazilian superstar aspas . Meanwhile, 100 Thieves retain much of their 2024 roster, with the one change being former M80 standout zander replacing bang , who moved to Sentinels . The winner of this match will play Sentinels, who finished fourth at Champions. NRG vs. Cloud9 NRG's busy offseason began with the team parting ways with crashies , Demon1 , and head coach Chet . They've rebuilt, picking up a pair of Tier 2 standouts in Verno and mada while picking bonkar to lead the charge as their new head coach. Cloud9 also had their fair of roster shuffling this year. They let go of vanity and runi , who had storied pasts with the organization, and picked up v1c and Rossy as their in-game leader to round out their five. However, a few weeks after losing in the grand final of RedBull Homeground , they parted ways with Rossy and signed mitch , who was last with the team in 2022. The two teams will clash to take on a star-studded G2 Esports in the upper quarterfinals. 2Game Esports vs. FURIA In a clash between Brazilian teams, FURIA will go head to head with 2Game Esports to welcome them to VCT. 2G, who defeated M80 in the grand final of Americas Ascension , boast an all-Brazilian roster. To circumvent the absence of Duelist player spike , who is ineligible due to being under 18, they picked up former Brazilian Challengers player gobera . FURIA still have some work to do in terms of roster rebuilding. They let go of kon4n , xand , and nzr after their season ended, and have just three players on their roster. Awaiting the winner is LEVIATÁN , who are also based in South America but boast a more diverse roster that's been bolstered by Demon1 and nataNk . At least year's Americas Kickoff , which was held with a three-group format that ended with a four-team single-elimination bracket, Sentinels defeated LOUD in five maps in the grand final. They qualified for Masters Madrid , where they defeated Pacific team Gen.G to lift their first international trophy since 2021. Americas Kickoff action will begin on January 16, with the two finalists of the event qualifying to Masters Bangkok."

She drew enough attention as the star of Misfits Black to earn a spot on Version1 's 2023 roster , which was an assembly of some of the strongest North American GC talent. This roster went on to dominate the scene, and after being signed by Shopify Rebellion Gold , would win the Game Changers Championship in 2023, avenging the organization's grand finals loss the previous year. Maintaining the same roster for 2024, Shopify entered Berlin looking to win back-to-back titles.

After spending the 2024 season overseas with T1 in Pacific, Rossy returned home to Americas to join Cloud9 as their new in-game leader. He, along with v1c , was one of the first signings of the off season, being announced just one day after the transfer window opened. In his short time with Cloud9, Rossy played in two off season tournaments. He debuted in blue at the SEN City Classic , where Cloud9 went winless, losing to each of Sentinels , Evil Geniuses , and NRG . A few weeks later, Cloud9 traveled to Berlin to participate in the Red Bull Home Ground tournament. In Berlin, Cloud9 found wins against the likes of FNATIC and Team Heretics before steamrolling G2 Esports , a tournament favorite, in the semifinals . It was Rossy's old team in T1 that put an end to their hot streak in the grand finals , where they were bested 3-1 in the series. Throughout the whole tournament, Rossy played lights out. He boasted the best performance of the main event with a 1.34 rating, clearing the next highest rating by a margin of 0.11. Cloud9 stated in their announcement that Rossy's removal was a result of his in-game leading \"not [meshing] with how the team wanted to play,\" and was a unanimous decision from players and coaches. Rossy has announced that he is now looking for a new team and that he holds “no hard feelings towards anyone apart of C9.” For mitch, this will be his second stint on Cloud9.

    "cleaned_content": "Paper Rex has won the Radiant Asia Invitational tournament, emerging victorious over DetonatioN FocusMe in the grand finals . They took the final series 3-1 to crown themselves the champions. The two teams faced off in the previous round of the tournament in the upper finals, where DFM won in 2-0 fashion. Paper Rex quickly rebounded in the lower final , where they swept Trace Esports in dominant fashion to earn themselves a rematch against DFM. Coming from the upper bracket, DFM dictated the map pool of the series, choosing to ban Bind and Split. The map pool consisted of Ascent, Haven, Abyss, Pearl, and Sunset. The teams traded each other's map picks, with Paper Rex winning Ascent 13-10 and DFM winning Haven 13-6. Paper Rex then took the next two maps, winning Abyss 13-2, and Pearl 13-7. DFM took Paper Rex to Ascent first, a map they had won comfortably in their previous match. After their loss, Paper Rex abandoned their off meta agent compositions they were so known for and finally leaned into the established meta. They utilized the map's default comp to great success against Trace Esports, where they dominated with a 13-4 scoreline. DFM seemed unfazed by Paper Rex's changeup as they opened up the map with five rounds in a row. It took heroics from Paper Rex to find any rounds, as DFM remained firmly in control all half to end with a 9-3 lead. Paper Rex opened up their attack side with a pistol win, before narrowly converting their bonus round off of a vintage mindfreak clutch. From there, the momentum was in their hands and DFM's lead quickly crumbled. They went on to win 10 out of the 11 rounds in the second half and secured the comeback with a 13-10 win. In a crucial round, mindfreak is ice cold as always. Moving to Paper Rex's map pick of Haven, DFM decided they needed an even bigger lead than on Ascent. This time, it was nine unanswered rounds and a 10-2 lead on their attack half. The combination of Meiy 's Neon and Art 's Odin proved to be too oppressive for Paper Rex to handle. The Art of the Odin It was once again up to Paper Rex to pull off the comeback on their attack. They started off with a pistol round, but could not convert the bonus round this time. They would find two more rounds, but it was once again the Odin play from Art that would help DFM secure the final two rounds, winning the map 13-6. Shaking off the results of Haven, Paper Rex responded with their own 10-2 half on Abyss. They quickly closed it out with three quick rounds in the second half for a 13-2 stomp of a map. Throughout the map, mindfreak was electric, putting up a 19-3 kill-death ratio, bringing his team to a 2-1 lead in the series. A brawl in A main, mindfreak comes out on top. Map four, for the fourth time of the series, started off with a 5-0 lead for the attacking team. This time it was DFM taking the lead on Pearl, a map which is historically one of Paper Rex's best. After DFM's hot start, however, Paper Rex found their footing and brought their way back up to a more even 7-5 scoreline at the half. In a similar story to Ascent, Paper Rex's attack was unstoppable. Once again winning the pistol and bonus round, they proceeded to sweep the rest of the map. Paper Rex won all eight rounds of the second half to close out the series and hoist themself a trophy. A ridiculous 3K from Jinggg to secure the series. While DFM fell short in the grand finals, they have proven that they can compete with some of the best teams from Pacific and China. After two years at the bottom of the Pacific league, they can enter 2025 with some promise of success. For Paper Rex, this tournament win places them back atop the Pacific league after slipping down the rungs towards the end of the 2024 VCT season."

They will next play against DetonatioN FocusMe in the grand final , a rematch of the upper final in which DFM came out on top. Trace has been eliminated from the tournament, finishing in third place after taking out DRX earlier in the bracket. “ alecks just banged the table and scolded us,” d4v41 joked after the series regarding their upper bracket loss to DFM. Comparing off-season performances, the map veto erred slightly in Trace's favor , as they had shown comfort on the second map, Ascent, and had a 3-0 record on map three, Sunset. Recent performances on the first three map picks also pointed towards a possible win from Trace, as Paper Rex had lost on Split and Ascent against DFM, while Trace found comfortable wins against DRX on Sunset and Split. However, Paper Rex reaching this stage via the upper bracket gave them priority in the veto, and picking into Trace's ideal map pool indicated confidence. Paper Rex kicked off the series on Split with a dominant attack, their double-duelist composition enabling quick site hits and overwhelming lone defenders. Trace was only able to win one round in the half, with LuoK1ng winning a close 1v1 against something . Trace called a timeout soon afterwards, but the Chinese lineup was unable to recover. By the end of the half, something had found 26 eliminations, equal to Trace's combined total kills. The star Jetts take over round 6 Returning from the break, LuoK1ng once again stepped up, scoring a second point for his team after a 4K. Trace was able to take a handful of rounds, but f0rsakeN dashed any comeback hopes with a perfect Guiding Light, ending the first map 13-5 The Southeast Asian roster opened Ascent with another pistol-bonus round win, countering Trace's offense with ease. Well-timed utility forced a three-player save from their opponents, and a tactical pause was called after the round. Trace took two points afterwards, opting to end B after six straight rounds of testing the A defense. A patient post-plant added a point to Trace's score, and the support players helped Trace earn their fourth, sending Ascent to halftime with an 8-4. Paper Rex forces Trace to save with a set play The second pistol round and a close anti-eco went Paper Rex's way, further extending their lead to a 10-4. A force-buy paid off, as d4v41 sealed a 1v1 with 14 HP remaining. Ultimately, two coordinated B hits ended Trace's map pick 13-4 in Paper Rex's favor. “He knows how to be aggressive at the right time, how to play safe at the right time,” d4v41 said regarding forsakeN's initiators on Ascent. Paper Rex continued their pistol dominance with their fourth opening round win on Sunset . Their signature aggression aided them in taking an early lead, but Trace was able to take advantage of a weak A site to tie the map. Trace continued with momentum in their favor, never shying away from showing presence on A site. The half ended 8-4, the first time Trace had taken the lead in the series. Kai 's reappearance was instrumental in Trace's recovery, as he went from 0 eliminations in the first four rounds to spearheading his team's attack and ending the half with 11 kills and 7 assists. Similarly, Biank and heybay each found eight and nine kills, respectively, after their team's comeback began in round five. Jinggg wins a 1v2 to swing momentum back in his team's favor Jinggg 's Deadlock helped break Trace's round winstreak and secure another pistol round for Paper Rex. An early mid-to-B fight gave Trace the bonus round, and the Chinese lineup went up to double digits with an A retake. Paper Rex continued closing the gap after taking a semi-eco, and a Jinggg 1v2 led to a timeout from their opponents. Biank avoided a 13-10 by stopping Paper Rex with a 3K, but an early B plant overwhelmed Trace, ending Sunset 13-11 and winning the series 3-0. The victory marks Paper Rex's third off-season grand final appearance in as many events, dating back to 2022's Valorant India Invitational . They will face off against DetonatioN FocusMe, the team that dropped Paper Rex to the lower bracket after a 2-0 win in the upper final. Trace Esports finishes the event in third place, a win against DRX helping them reach the podium on home soil. After the series, d4v41 commented on the grand final rematch. “DFM [...] has very good aim. Props to them, they've been working very hard,” he said. “Hopefully things will be different when we meet them tomorrow.”"

After DRX won the pistol and second round, Trace would win nine rounds unanswered before a 3K from HYUNMIN finally stopped them. DRX would start the second half with another pistol win, trying to claw back from the 9-3 deficit. Another HYUNMIN 3K put them on track to win the bonus, but heybay and Kai would orchestrate a 2v5 to curb the DRX comeback. It wasn't long before Trace closed out the map 13-7. Kai put up a dominant performance on Neon, with 26 kills on the map, and numerous round winning multi-kills for his team. DRX had no answer for Kai's Neon on Sunset.

This advances DFM to the grand final , while Paper Rex goes down to the lower final . The two map series was played on Split and Ascent. DFM took both maps with scores of 15-13 and 13-8 respectively. Paper Rex and DFM have a short history with each other. They have faced off only three times before, two of them being their regular season matches in the Pacific league. Given DFM's lack of success in the league, Paper Rex has dominated every match, having never dropped a map to them before. However, this iteration of DFM has proven more competitive than ever before, having taken down numerous top teams in their tournament run, including the reigning world champions, EDward Gaming . The first map was Paper Rex's pick of Split, a home ground for them, having already played it three times this tournament. DFM's pistol win was immediately answered by a round two thrifty, giving Paper Rex an early lead and momentum in the half. They would quickly jump out to a 6-2 lead, but Jinboong would claw back some rounds for DFM, bringing their half score up to five. Despite a second pistol win for DFM, the second half started with a string of Paper Rex wins, bringing them up to an 11-8 lead. However, in classic Paper Rex fashion, they would squander their anti-eco to allow DFM a chance back into the game. Four rounds in a row brought DFM to 12, before Paper Rex took the final round to bring about their seventh overtime of the tournament. For the first three rounds of overtime, the two teams took turns trading defensive rounds, until SSeeS , the stand-in for DFM, found a 1v3 on the B site to win the organization's first ever map against Paper Rex. SSeeS clutches out the map in overtime. The second map played was Ascent, a map which has infamously plagued Paper Rex for the past year. In contrast, Ascent is one of the few maps where DFM was able to find any success in their Pacific campaign. Paper Rex's discomfort on the map was almost immediately evident. After they won the pistol and second round, DFM took the next six rounds unanswered. The half would end at 8-4 in favor of DFM. Paper Rex came out in the second half to win their second pistol of the map, and would go further to win the bonus round, bringing them back into the game. However, once again, the eco round would strike, and DFM, armed with only Sheriffs, would win the round and halt any chance of a Paper Rex comeback. DFM dominated the rest of the half, and closed out the map 13-8. Meiy led the server with 21 kills. With this win, DFM continue their undefeated run in the tournament, having yet to lose a match.

DetonatioN enters the playoffs as a top seed from the Swiss stage , having defeated 2024 Champions EDward Gaming in their opening series and Rex Regum Qeon in their second match . Trace, meanwhile, went the distance, as they lost to RRQ but defeated Bilibili and Gen.G on their way to playoffs. The map veto slightly favored DetonatioN , who have played Haven, the series' decider map, three times in the off-season. Despite a low winrate, the map scores have remained close for the Japanese team. Haven was previously a first ban for Trace , but it has remained open during their Radiant Asia Invitational run. Similarly, Abyss and Ascent slightly favored DFM in terms of winrate, but Trace had more series on both maps in comparison. The match began on Ascent , where DFM took an early lead after winning the first three rounds. Trace recovered, winning an eco and Biank 's Odin helping break down the defense. Art and Meiy helped DFM recover, setting them on track to win the half 7-5. The duo ended their defense with a combined 22 eliminations, with Akame contributing 10 assists and a final-round 3K. The second half mirrored the first, as DFM's offense extended their total streak to eight rounds in a row. Art earned an ace against the eco round, and closed out the third round after a last-minute rotation. Despite DetonatioN's lead, Trace countered their slow rounds, drawing out both of the attacker's timeouts at 11-10. The Japanese squad appeared desperate, unable to find an entrance into Trace's Odin-Operator stronghold. Kai and heybay ended Ascent 13-11 with a double-kill each. Kai and heybay stop DFM's exec in its tracks Trace took over Abyss for their attack half, taking their first pistol of the series and further extending their lead with a round 4 win after two early kills. Biank opened the fifth round with an early Hunter's Fury kill, forcing DFM to save for the second round in a row. A Kai 3K prompted DFM's timeout, which in turn helped DFM adapt to Trace's B hit and win their second round of the map. Two rounds for DFM led to Trace's own timeout. The Chinese roster seemed to expect aggression from the defense, but their Operator purchase did not pay off, as DFM patiently closed out the half 6-6. DetonatioN continued winning the pistol and bonus round, their third half of the match to begin 3-0 in their favor. SSeeS helped his team go up 11-6 with a 3K, and Art returned to the Odin for a triple of his own. Trace was only able to win two more rounds, with DFM's lead proving too much to overcome. Jinboong began the final round with his 23rd kill, leaving him just shy of 300 ACS for their 13-8 map win. Kai opened Haven with a Classic 4K, helping Trace go up 3-0 to start the decider. Meiy was key the next two rounds, sealing a hectic fourth round with a 1v1 and opening the following round with a collateral. Trace's attack remained chaotic, which earned them a nearly-flawless round but was quickly shut down the next round. Two quick retakes from DFM put them in the lead, an advantage extended thanks to the Odin-Operator and DFM's coordinated retakes. Meiy closes out a chaotic round four to put his team on the board A quick A take earned DFM their fourth pistol round, eventually setting the score at 9-5. LuoK1ng held strong on C to close the gap, but an early A main fight went DFM's way, netting the Pacific squad double digits. heybay took over garage to set the score 11-7, but Akame opened up the B site the following round to reach match point. Trace's damaged economy was not enough to stay alive, as DFM won a 3v3 to end Haven 13-7 and win the series 2-1. With this win, DetonatioN FocusMe remains undefeated in the Radiant Asia Invitational, as they qualified to playoffs after victories against EDward Gaming and Rex Regum Qeon. DetonatioN is the only team at the event with a flawless record, as the other top seed, DRX, lost to Paper Rex earlier in the playoffs."

Paper Rex now advances to the upper final , while DRX has been sent down to the lower bracket. The three-map series played out on Sunset, Abyss, and Pearl. Paper Rex won Sunset 15-13, DRX won Abyss 13-6, and Paper Rex won Pearl 13-6. This was the tenth matchup between the two age-old Pacific heavyweights, the most recent result being a 3-2 win for DRX in the lower finals of Pacific Stage 2 this year. DRX entered as the higher seed after a 2-0 Swiss stage, while Paper Rex fought their way through Swiss with a 2-1 record that featured five overtime maps. PRX kicked off the match by taking DRX to Sunset, a map they hadn't yet played in this event. In a continuation of their role experimentation for this event, PRX's composition featured Jinggg on Deadlock, something on Sova, and f0rsakeN on Neon. On the other side, DRX elected for a more standard composition featuring Neon, KAY/O, and Cypher. Despite suffering a thrifty loss in round 2, PRX opened up an early 5-2 lead on their defense side through coordinated retakes, forcing a DRX timeout. In the round after, free1ng won out a 1v1 versus d4v41 to stop the snowball, culminating to a closer 7-5 half in favor of PRX. The second half was equally close; DRX began building momentum with a narrow bonus win in round 15, but a 1v4 from something in round 17 gave his team a way back in. DRX managed to find a 12-11 lead, but PRX forced a sixth overtime this event for themselves with an ironclad B site postplant. Experience proved to be the difference-maker as PRX won another manic firefight on the B site to close out Sunset 15-13. something clutches a pivotal round for his team with a little help from the crowd. Both Neon players topped the scoreboard for their teams, but it was f0rsaken who took over with 26 kills to 19 deaths and 282 ACS. The next map was DRX's pick of Abyss, a map DRX hadn't lost on since July. DRX opted for their signature Ascent-esque composition with Jett, KAY/O, and Cypher, while PRX brought out their unique composition with Jett, Reyna, and Skye. Another round 2 thrifty for DRX helped them mount a 3-1 start. PRX utilized strong A hits and individual hero plays to keep the score close, but DRX adjusted their defensive setups to better reinforce their site anchors and end the half with a 7-5 lead. Crisp shots from HYUNMIN shut down the attack. The second half of Abyss, on the other hand, was anything but close. DRX exploited Paper Rex's lack of strong defensive utility to repeatedly take the B site, steamrolling to a 13-6 victory. Flashback dominated the server with 22 kills and 315 ACS; HYUNMIN trailed close behind on Jett with 20 kills and 274 ACS. The last map was Pearl, a map DRX hadn't yet played since its return to the map pool. Steadfast anchoring from MaKo on A gave DRX a 3-1 start, but PRX found greater purchase on B to find a 5-3 lead that chained into an 8-4 half. Jinggg expertly wields Phoenix's kit to deal with MaKo's Cosmic Divide. DRX took both pistols, but the rest of the map looked comfortable for PRX as the squad ran away with Pearl to win out the map 13-6. mindfreak led his team with 20 kills and 297 ACS after an impressive display of anchoring and lurking. However, it was Jinggg who demonstrated the best performance statistically over the course of the entire series with 59 kills to 44 deaths and 244 ACS. Paper Rex will return tomorrow on Nov. 29 to play the winner of DetonatioN FocusMe versus Trace Esports in the upper final , while DRX will fight for survival against the loser in the lower bracket ."

He is the last signing after MIBR completed the acquisitions of Eduardo \" xenom \" Soeiro , Gabriel \" cortezia \" Cortez and Agustin \" nzr \" Ibarra . The move comes after MIBR reached an agreement with Leviatán to buy out the player's contract, as his deal with the Argentine side was believed to run until 2025. Since the end of their 2024 season, Leviatán also signed former NRG and Evil Geniuses duelist Max \" Demon1 \" Mazanov , which expanded the team's active roster to six. aspas will be on his third team in as many years, having spent just one season with Leviatán in 2024 after leaving Brazilian giants LOUD at the end of 2023. His 2024 season with Leviatán saw the team lift its first-ever trophy at Americas Stage 2 and reach its second-ever Champions event. They finished third at Champions 2024 following a upper final loss to eventual champions EDward Gaming . While he is most known for his play on Jett and Raze, changes to the meta in 2024 also saw him pick up Neon. Since joining LOUD in 2022, aspas has been surrounded by several world-class teammates, including Matias \" saadhak \" Delipetro , Gustavo \" Sacy \" Rossi , and Felipe \" Less \" de Loyola Basso . He joins an MIBR roster that has little to no international experience nor has a single player with experience lifting a trophy at Valorant's highest level. After signing with LOUD, aspas immediately enjoyed a trophy-laden 2022 season with them. The team completed an unbeaten campaign at Brazil Stage 1 Challengers, qualifying for Masters Reykjavik , where they lost in the grand final to OpTic Gaming . They then continued their domestic dominance with an undefeated showing at Brazil Stage 2 Challengers , qualifying for Masters Copenhagen and Champions 2022 through circuit points. Following a disappointing showing at Masters, LOUD managed to lift the Champions trophy , exacting revenge on OpTic in back-to-back meetings to earn Brazil and the Americas region its first world championship.

Excluding the league's Promotion Cup, in which Diamant did not participate, westside was a top-ten player by rating in Split 2 with a rating of 1.08. The team qualified to the EMEA Ascension play-ins but were eliminated in the group stage with a 1-1 record. westside, along with runneR, also recently competed for GIANTX in a merged co-ed roster with GIANTX GC to win the EMEA Spotlight Series in October. runneR last played for Team Vitality . He began the season serving as the team's Duelist, during which the team narrowly failed to qualify for the EMEA Stage 1 playoffs in a five-way 3-3 tiebreaker in Group Alpha. After Stage 1, he swapped roles with Sayf , adopting the Sentinel position. Vitality went on to finish second in Stage 2 and qualify for Champions 2024 , exiting the group stage in Seoul with a 1-2 record. According to the announcement , he will be playing flex for GIANTX. tomaszy comes into the team after a year playing a Sentinel-focused flex role for Karmine Corp . Under the French banner, the team carved a blazing run to win EMEA Kickoff and qualify for Masters Madrid , where they placed top-six. That result would end up being Karmine Corp's peak for the year, as they ended the season with a 4-6 record and were unable to qualify for any other international events. He will be switching to the Controller role for GIANTX. Following a strong 2023 season in which they won the EMEA Last Chance Qualifier and qualified to Champions 2023 , GIANTX only made one roster change by adding Igor \" Redgar \" Vlasov after the retirement of Emir \" rhyme \" Muminovic . However, they were unable to replicate their previous performances. A 0-2 Kickoff saw the team release Žygimantas \" nukkye \" Chmieliauskas , add Semyon \" purp0 \" Borchev as their Duelist, and shift Adolfo \" Fit1nho \" Gallego to the flex role. GIANTX eventually ended the regular season in ninth place with a 3-7 overall record, failing to qualify for playoffs in both stages.

    "cleaned_content": "Following the conclusion of its Swiss Stage, Valorant Radiant Asia Invitational has shaved its field of eight teams down to four. DRX , DetonatioN FocusMe , Trace Esports , and Paper Rex have qualified for the playoffs after securing four wins in the Swiss Stage. 2-0: Dominant starts DRX earned its spot in the playoffs after wins over Bilibili Gaming and fellow South Korean team Gen.G . They were among the first teams to secure entry into the playoffs, finishing with a 2-0 record. They have experienced significant changes this offseason, parting ways with BuZz , Foxy9 , and BeYN . MaKo and Flashback are their only returnees, Additionally, head coach termi is not in Chengdu for the event, meaning glow and Argency have taken over coaching duties. DetonatioN FocusMe turned heads to open the event with a 2-1 victory over Champions 2024 winners EDward Gaming . After a first map loss that seemed almost unsalvageable, they stormed back and won maps two and three. Abyss, the third map, was won dominantly, 13-5. They then secured a playoff spot in reverse-sweep fashion again over Rex Regum Qeon , winning in three maps. DFM has also experienced a roster shakeup this offseason, only retaining Meiy while picking up players from Japan's VCL circuit and a rookie in gyen . 2-1: Bent, not broken Paper Rex suffered defeat in their opening match, losing a three-map, 88-round match to Gen.G. Following the loss, they toughed out a win against home favorites EDward Gaming, defeating and eliminating them in three maps, before eliminating fellow regional representatives Rex Regum Qeon in three maps. The fast-flying and entertaining playstyle of Paper Rex continues, with any of the five players liable to top the leaderboard on any given map. Trace Esports turned heads in the competition by qualifying for the playoffs. The Chinese team, which captured hearts with a Cinderella run to the playoffs of Champions 2024, fell flat in their opening match, losing 2-0 to RRQ. They then followed that up by defeating fellow Chinese team BLG 2-1, and then upsetting competition favorites Gen.G with a 2-0 defeat. Trace retained much of its 2024 roster, and the added level of familiarity seemed to show. Duelist Kai has topped the leaderboard in two matches, while LuoK1ng continues to show good form. 1-2: So close, yet so far Rex Regum Qeon opened the competition with a convincing 2-0 victory over Trace, but were eliminated after 2-1 losses to DFM and PRX. They have not had much roster turnover this offseason, but go into the 2025 season looking to make the jump to the next step after a 5th-6th place finish in Pacific Stage 2 . Gen.G were widely considered one of the favorites for this competition, and that seemed to ring true to begin things for the Masters Shanghai winners. After coming out on top in an instant classic three-map clash with Pacific Giants PRX, they faltered against fellow Korean team DRX, losing narrowly in three maps. Their elimination match, a 2-0 loss to Trace Esports, was only close on the second map, which they lost 14-12. Gen.G, which replaced two core pieces from the 2024 squad, will look to retain their spot at the top of the Pacific league in 2025. 0-2: Out in a hurry Champions Seoul winners EDward Gaming were swiftly eliminated. Across six maps in two matches against DFM and PRX, they lost by a difference of 11 rounds. After sending only a few starting players to the Gwangju Esports Series , EDG participated in this competition with their full 2024 roster. They made no changes, but seemed to have some postseason rust that will need to be shaken off heading into 2025. The Chinese region had three teams in this competition, and two of them were eliminated in the Swiss Stage. The second team eliminated early on was BiliBili Gaming . Their elimination came much quicker, with a 2-0 loss to DRX and a 2-1 loss to Trace. They have made a few changes to their roster after the 2024 season, but still seem to be second, or even third, fiddle in their region. Playoffs DRX vs Paper Rex DetonatioN FocusMe vs Trace Esports The rest of the competition will be played out in a four-team, double-elimination bracket. Only the grand final and the lower finals will be best-of-five, while all other matches are best-of-three."

Last season with xenom, they finished fourth in Split 2, falling short of qualifying for Americas Ascension . They also failed to qualify through circuit points by a margin of 15 points, falling behind eventual Ascension winners 2Game Esports . In signing with MIBR, the Brazilian will make the jump to the top tier of Valorant for the first time. Before joining Stellae ahead of the Brazil VCL's Split 2 , xenom played for TBK Esports , TropiCaos , and Laboratorio do Leozin , making his professional Valorant debut for the latter in 2022. While he has played several roles throughout the course of his career, he was the Controller player for Stellae in 2024, mainly playing Omen but also playing Brimstone and Viper on occasion. cortezia joins after spending the 2024 season with RED Canids . Like xenom, he mainly played the Controller role for his team. He played a wide range of agents, with Harbor being the only Controller agent he did not log a map on. Before RED Canids, he played for fellow Brazilian VCL teams TropiCao and Team Brave Soldiers . He made his professional Valorant debut in late 2020, but found his first organization in 2022 Challengers side Without Org . nzr joins widely believed to be the team's Initiator player.

We are also happy for the players and coach who will have access to additional training facilities and support as part of this acquisition.\" Sin Prisa Gaming grew quickly in the 2024 season, from one of the more unknown teams in the Korean VCL circuits to one of its most dominant. Known originally as Team OGS , current players Dambi , Ivy , and Francis were on the squad before it disbanded after its elimination from The Korean WCG Challengers League Split 2. Current DRX player Athan was also on Team OGS. For a short portion of the 2023 season, the roster was also picked up by Gwangju Shadow . For the 2024 season, the three players stayed together as Sin Prisa Gaming, and were joined by Persia and margaret . After a rocky Split 1 that saw them fail to qualify for playoffs, they dominated Split 2 , which they'd only reached by qualifying through a playoff. In Stage 2, they went on a run of eleven straight victories, only dropping six maps in the process before defeating NongShim RedForce in the grand final to reach Pacific Ascension . Their dominance, branded by an aggressive approach on both sides of the map, continued throughout Ascension as they won five straight matches, only dropping two maps in the grand final en route to securing a spot in VCT for the 2025 season. With the backing of NongShim, a South Korean food company best known for instant noodles and snacks, the former Sin Prisa Gaming team will have more resources and infrastructure than they did prior. NongShim also fields a League of Legends team that competes in LCK, one of the most prestigious LoL leagues in the world. Nongshim RedForce first entered professional Valorant in 2022, never quite reaching the heights that its League of Legends team did. They achieved their best result to date in the 2024 season, reaching the grand final of the Korean Challengers League, where they fell to Sin Prisa Gaming. In the announcement by Riot Games, it was revealed that the NongShim roster, which is currently competing in the playoffs of VCL Korea Split 3 , will no longer be affiliated with NongShim following the end of the competition.

However, Juicy's young age prevented him from reaping the rewards of his efforts, as he was ineligible for league play at the time. He spent the following year in the Malaysia/Singapore circuit with Bleed's partner team, Disguised . He helped Disguised rise to the top of the circuit, eventually winning the league to become the region's representatives at Pacific Ascension . Juicy would not be able to repeat his Ascension victory, as Disguised were narrowly defeated by grand finalists BOOM Esports , with both of their map losses coming in overtime.

The Koreans managed to show up in the series despite an abysmal 25% pistol win rate with excellent gun rounds and by coming out on top in individual duels. T1 and Cloud9 opted to use their singular bans on Sunset and Ascent respectively before alternating picks for the best-of-five series. Flashes of brilliance from BuZz 's Yoru opened up Abyss, T1's first pick. T1 took a 4-1 lead thanks to their layered Breach stuns and Yoru flashes before a timeout was forced out from C9 coach Immi . Although aggressive plays from OXY and moose gave C9 a short string of three rounds, T1 had the lead at halftime with a 7-5 score. OXY's mechanics were on full display in the second pistol. An explosive 4K from OXY to win the second pistol was immediately responded to with a full eco win from T1. A huge 1v3 from Rossy in round 17 dragged C9 back into the game after going down 6-10. BuZz followed by bringing out the Operator and finding two picks in the following round to reset C9's economy. Some hero plays from Rossy and OXY forced out a timeout from Autumn before T1 closed out the first map 13-10. The trio of BuZz, Sylvan , and iZu provided dividends for T1 and made up for uncharacteristically absent performances from Meteor and stax . BuZz was the match MVP, topping the server with a 1.39 rating, 314 ACS, and 25 kills. iZu secured map point for T1 with a 4K. T1 once again struggled on Pearl to start as five straight B hits in a row from C9 put them up 5-0. Two separate thrifty rounds followed from T1 to give them a chance to bring the half to a respectable deficit. iZu's Operator and impact kills from Sylvan closed the gap to just two rounds as C9 led 7-5 at halftime. A v1c 3K paved the way for another C9 pistol, their third of the series, to go up 9-5. A ridiculous entry 3K from BuZz was just a bump in the road for C9 as OXY answered back with a 3K of his own in the following round. Although a closer affair than T1's game against FUT , Cloud9 comfortably tied up the series 1-1 with a 13-8 on Pearl. OXY and v1c were the standouts for C9 on the second map with 22 and 18 kills respectively, while both recorded a server high 86% KAST. Both had to overcome strong showings from their Neon and Astra counterparts, BuZz and Sylvan, and did so triumphantly. BuZz's antics helped keep Pearl from being a blowout. A fourth pistol from Cloud9 opened up T1's second pick, Bind, a map they had previously demolished FUT on earlier in the day. While Rossy pushed his team towards a 5-3 lead, stax pulled off an incredible 1v4 to tie up the map 5-5. The score was sitting on a knife-edge at 6-6 before halftime. stax showed up for T1 when it mattered most. C9 proved they were still the pistol gods with their fifth pistol win in the series to go up 8-6. This time around it was Sylvan who provided the hero play for T1 to take a slight lead at 9-8 and prevent C9 from abusing the B site. Multikill after multikill came C9's way from T1 to put the Koreans on map point 12-8. A seventh straight round came the way of T1 to close out Bind 13-8 and put T1 on series point at 2-1. Despite losing both pistols, T1 managed to be dominant in the gun rounds to push themselves over the line. The quartet of Meteor, stax, Sylvan, and BuZz took turns contributing to their team's success with Meteor being the MVP of the map with a 1.25 rating and 166 ADR. OXY had a rare weak performance on the third map despite his explosive pistol round, picking up just 9 kills in the game to bottom out the scoreboard. It was Sylvan's turn to make a hero play for T1. The fourth map, Haven, kicked off with yet another C9 pistol before a saviour BuZz 4K tied up the score at 2-2. A 1v2 from stax stopped a string of traded rounds to give T1 a lead at 5-3. C9 had no way of dealing with impenetrable A post-plant setups from T1 as the Pacific reps grabbed an 8-4 first half. BuZz has been a consistent star for T1. T1 grabbed an ever-elusive second pistol thanks to a stax 1v2 to go within touching distance of the trophy at 10-4. Map point at 12-6 came soon after as BuZz and stax put in the work to ensure a trophy lift. BuZz was far and away the finals MVP with a 1.39 series rating, 170 ADR, and an absurd 20/6 first kill to first death ratio. stax won a 1v2 to win the most important pistol of the series. T1 are the champions of Red Bull Home Ground #5. T1 win Red Bull Home Ground #5."

FUT got off to an explosive start on Bind with pistol and bonus round wins. T1 could thank back-to-back multikills from BuZz for cutting FUT's momentum and giving his team a way back into the game. The Koreans led 7-5 before halftime with an ace from yetujey breaking up seven dominant rounds from T1. yetujey's ace gave FUT an extra round in the first half. Unfortunately for FUT, T1 wouldn't slow down in the second half and took six straight to close out the map 13-5. iZu and BuZz had particularly standout performances with the latter's multikills and the former's consistency across the map ensuring a T1 victory. T1's pick, Pearl, kicked off with another strong start from FUT, going up 7-0 with an unorthodox double-sentinel comp featuring Vyse and Killjoy. T1's insistence on ignoring the B site worked perfectly for FUT as T1 struggled to get the spike planted. FUT closed out their defense with a 9-3 score before picking up the second pistol to go up 11-3. Afterwards, it was a mere formality for FUT to close out Pearl 13-3 and force a third map. New addition xeus was the MVP for FUT as the 20-year-old duelist picked up 22 kills and 225 ADR on the second map. xeus closed out the map with a 4K. The third map, Ascent, opened with FUT picking up another pistol, their fourth of the series. A 4K from xeus' Yoru in the bonus led FUT to a 5-0 start before T1 could respond with a thrifty. Impressive holds from T1's individuals shut down FUT's site executes to force a 6-6 half. xeus excelled on the off-meta Yoru. T1 took a crucial pistol and bonus in the second half to take a commanding 9-6 lead on the decider. T1's midrounding ran circles around FUT on their attack, suffocating their opponent's map control. T1 closed out Ascent 13-10 with an A hit to take the series 2-1. BuZz had an impressive 251 ACS and 20 kills on the final map. Meteor's mechanics were on point during all three maps. T1 will play Cloud9 in a best-of-five grand final, while FUT has been eliminated."

    "cleaned_content": "MIBR has parted ways with four players who joined within the past year, letting go of Felipe \" liazzi \" Galiazzi , Davi \" Palla \" Alcides , Gabriel \" rich \" Rosa , and Matheus \" mazin \" Araújo . With Stage 2 playoffs a near impossibility after just completing Stage 1 , MIBR made midseason changes looking to turn its fortunes around. In the coaching booth, they parted ways with former LOUD coach bzkA , promoting another former LOUD coach in fRoD to right the ship. On the stage, they parted ways with RgLMeister , frz , and jzz . They brought in liazzi, Palla, and mazin to replace them, while also relying on the duties of Pa1nt and ShahZaM to circumvent visa issues for their new signings. After just four matches for the organization and five months later, liazzi is once again LFT. Before joining MIBR, he played for OLIMPO and FURIA among other teams, and began his career in 2020 with exuLt.gg . He never quite had a defined role for MIBR in his brief stint with the team, but played the Sentinel and Initiator roles mostly throughout the course of his eleven maps with the team. Palla joined from Brazilian VCL team Stellae Gaming . He played as MIBR's Duelist, dividing selection between Raze and Jett. Stellae and MIBR were his first stretches as a pro Valorant player in the first or second tier. rich was MIBR's Initiator in the second half of the 2024 season, playing Gekko, Fade, Sova, and Skye. He also joined from the Challengers level, having previously played for Legacy . He made his debut in 2021 with ARDUINOS . Of the four players released, mazin is the only player who was on the MIBR roster before the 2024 season began. He joined in the offseason following 2023, which ended with the team finishing ninth out of ten teams, and bowing out in the first round of the LCQ. The Controller player joined from FURIA, after having stops at TERROR.NET and B4 Esports . The roster changes come following a disappointing 2024 season for the Brazilian side. After reaching the play-ins of Americas Kickoff where they defeated eventual Stage 2 runners-up G2 Esports , MIBR went on a run of nine straight matches without victory, only winning one map in the process. They struggled to regain the form they had at Kickoff, with a season-ending victory against Evil Geniuses being the only thing preventing them from going 0-11 in league play. They ended at the bottom of the Stage 2 standings, failing to qualify for the playoffs in any event they competed in. With just months to go before the 2025 VCT season begins, MIBR have four roster spots to fill, looking to finish above the bottom two of the Americas league for the first time since the beginning of franchising. MIBR 's full roster is now: Arthur \" artzin \" Araujo Felipe \" chivitz \" Chivitz (Manager) Daniel \" fRoD \" Montaner (Head coach) Iara \" Iara \" Rodrigo (Analyst)"

The maps for this series were Sunset from G2 and Pearl from C9, leaving Bind as the decider. This series was defined by the unstoppable attack side from C9, as well as some G2 pistol and bonus round woes. The series began on Sunset, with C9 winning both the pistol and the bonus round to build an early lead. G2 had to end the half strong to keep the map within reach, and they did just that to enter the half down only 7-5. When the second half began and C9 won the second pistol round, they steamrolled over G2 with good aim from OXY on Neon and a key triple kill from Xeppaa on Breach. The second half was dominant from C9 , winning the map 13-5. G2 had to win on Pearl to keep their tournament hopes alive. C9 kept their pistol rounds perfect with another round victory and bonus conversion to start Pearl, catching G2 off guard with constant two-man stacks and pop-flash plays. However, like map one, G2 ended that run, this time off of a clutch mid hold from JonahP . JonahP holds strong with three kills against Cloud9. G2 had a tough time preventing C9 from taking site and winning post-plants, especially with the hoard of utility from the Astra-led composition. Like Sunset, G2 adapted late into the half to keep the map winnable, down 8-4. However, C9 won their fourth straight pistol off of a great two-man push from mid, and they converted their fourth straight bonus to win the map 13-4 and the series 2-0. For this series, the MVP was OXY as he outplayed his counterpart jawgemo with 43 kills across two maps, as well as 13 first kills with only four first deaths. With this win, C9 is in the Red Bull Home Ground #5 finals and will face the winners of the T1 versus FUT Esports match in the tournament finals."

On the other side, G2 successfully defeated Karmine Corp in their first game but later lost to T1 . On top of determining which team would go home, this series also served as a rematch of the Champions 2024 lower round 1 , where FNATIC eliminated G2 in 2-0 fashion. The match kicked off on FNATIC's map pick of Haven, where they dominated FOKUS 13-4 yesterday. They opted for their signature Yoru-Iso composition, while G2 brought out a standard Neon-Breach. Despite FNATIC's exceptional winrate on the map, G2 was in control throughout the first half on their defense, consistently countering FNATIC's pressure around the map with proactive reclears and coordinated floods to take an 8-4 lead. A second pistol win for G2 seemed to set them up for a simple win. However, reality was more complicated, as the next three rounds saw three back-and-forth round wins by the team with worse weaponry. G2 eventually stabilized in the chaos with two strong C hits to get up to 12-8.

However, it was Alfajer leading in almost every category with 316 ACS, 24 kills, 8 of which first kills, and 215 ADR. The next map was G2's pick of Bind. Both teams selected relatively standard compositions, with Alfajer notably playing Raze for FNATIC and kaajak playing Gekko instead. G2's defense half on Bind proved to be even stronger than it was on Haven as they chained a pistol win into a bonus. FNATIC almost managed to win a thrifty in round 4 off the back of sharp Sheriff shots from kaajak, but jawgemo won out a 1v2 to secure the round. jawgemo picks up the pieces for his team in the clutch. From there, the rest of the game was smooth sailing for G2; they consistently burned down the clock, either cleanly retaking the sites or denying FNATIC the opportunity to plant altogether. This time, G2 easily carried forward the momentum from a second pistol win to win Bind 13-2. leaf dominated the opposition with an outsized 2.22 rating, 419 ACS, 93% KAST, and 26 kills to only 7 deaths. With this win, G2 is set to play Cloud9 today in the semifinals to determine who will secure the first spot in the grand final against the winner of FUT Esports versus T1."

In this format, four teams will qualify to the playoffs, if they can win two BO1s. G2 Esports defeated the new Karmine Corp roster on Haven, barely breaking a sweat, with a score of 13-7 while the fourth game of the day saw T1 take down FUT Esports in a 13-7 fashion on Ascent. G2 Esports vs Karmine Corp While G2 maintained their roster which had found them qualifying consistently for international events, including Champions 2024, KC were coming in with an almost complete roster rebuild, with only marteen left from the 2024 VCT season. Both teams had an almost-mirror comp, with the sole difference being Omen on G2's side while KC opted for the Astra. G2 started off strong with a pistol round win, and a failed force-buy attempt in round two ensured they got to a 3-0 start. KC were able to convert their full-buy round with saadhak winning a 1v1 against trent . Another G2 round win saw KC once again pushed into an eco which G2 won, pushing their lead to 5-1. KC won the upcoming buy with three left alive, and post a timeout, they regained their footing to tie things up at 5-5.

They won five straight rounds in a row as Trent found two 3Ks and Jawgemo a 3K and 4K, continuing their blistering pace from the first half. It seemed over at 12-5, but KC still had some fight in them, with them winning a 2V5 and then Marteen clutching a 1v1 against Jawgemo. G2 closed out the next round to lock in their win 13-7. Jawgemo was the MVP with 27 kills on Neon – equal to the top two players on KC put together – and a kill differential of +20. Trent was close behind with 24 frags of his own. In contrast, all of KC went negative in terms of kill differential and their top frag – Marteen – had 14 kills to his name. “Our loss against FUT yesterday refreshed us as a team, it made us focus and figure out what our goals are.” said Jawgemo. The G2 duelist also casually dropped a bomb with him mentioning he always changes his settings before every event, while also calling his 347 ACS performance today “shaky.” T1 vs FUT Esports FUT came into the main stage through the international play-ins without losing a game, while T1 won the APAC play-ins to qualify. FUT had benched cNed , fielding xeus in his place, while T1 had rebuilt the roster with Masters Shanghai winners Meteor and Sylvan joining, as well as ex-DRX player BuZz joining the team, keeping only iZu and stax from 2024's VCT season. Ascent was the chosen map of play, with T1 starting on attack. FUT were able to win the pistol and anti-eco, with T1 converting their full-buy and the following round with 3Ks from Meteor and Sylvan respectively. FUT bounced back with a retake of their own but an ace from Meteor tied things up at 3-3 again. The half continued in a back and forth fashion, concluding 6-6. Meteor is clean in the clutch. With the side-swap though, T1 looked like they could do no wrong. They won six rounds in a row, the last with a 4K from Stax to reach match point. FUT finally got on the board for the first time in the half with AtaKaptan winning a 1v1 to bring the score to 12-7, but T1 won the next round to take the map 13-7. T1's Meteor had an absolutely ballistic game on the Killjoy, going +13 in terms of kill differential and a 311 ACS. For FUT's side, Atakaptan was the MVP with 19 frags and an ACS of 265.

    "cleaned_content": "Team Heretics and Cloud9 started things off on the right foot, moving one win closer to playoff qualification to open the main stage action at Red Bull Home Ground #5 . Team Heretics secured their win on Split, defeating Germany-based second-tier side FOKUS 13-11 on Split. Meanwhile, a new-look Cloud9 went up against European giants FNATIC , defeating them on Abyss 13-11. The Swiss Stage format, which VCT fans may recognize as familiar from Masters Madrid, sees the event's teams pitted against each other by teams of identical records. The four teams to reach two victories will qualify to the event's playoffs, while the teams with two losses will be eliminated. The other half of the field will play their opening matches of the Swiss Stage later on the same day, with the next pairing of matches, the first set of qualification and elimination matches, taking place on Friday. Team Heretics vs FOKUS Team Heretics entered this matchup as the overwhelming favorite, having been one of the EMEA region's strongest teams in the 2024 season. They carry over much of the same roster into the 2025 season, centered around a young core that saw them reach four grand finals but lift none last season. However, they appeared to have some rust to shake off early on. Split, a relatively well-balanced map as far as attacking and defending goes, seemed to be defense-sided in this particular clash. After stealing the anti-eco round, the German team got out to a 5-1 lead which bubbled into an 8-4 halftime advantage. There was an element of experimentation in Team Heretics' approach, though. They have tried several different team compositions on Split over the past season, a map that's been tough for them in stretches. On Thursday, they opted for a triple-Initiator, no-Sentinel composition that saw in-game leader Boo on KAY/O and benjyfishy on Breach. While Team Heretics grabbed eight of the first nine rounds to open the second half, they started with ground to make up. A late surge by FOKUS seemed to threaten overtime, but a well-executed round with anchors from the right players and good mechanics saw them hold onto victory. The winning round for Team Heretics. Team Heretics Duelist MiniBoo topped the scoreboard, putting up 20 kills and a server-leading ACS of 239 in the win. On the other side, Mistic, formerly of Fnatic, Apeks , and Team Liquid , led the way for FOKUS with a team-leading 20 kills of his own. Cloud9 vs FNATIC FNATIC, on the double-Duelist composition which saw Alfajer pick up Iso and new signing kaajak on Yoru, had no trouble carrying that picking up space on the large two-site map, heading into the second half with a 9-3 lead. They won six of the last seven rounds, with some vintage heroics from the most decorated player in Valorant history. They don't call him the Ice Man for nothing. Fnatic's 16-year-old stand-in Sayonara took to the stage in place of Leo , who has been on the bench since the end of the team's Masters Madrid campaign. The youngster, who most recently showed out for EMEA Ascension side KPI Gaming went blow-for-blow with his tier-one opponents, finishing the map with 21 kills The side switch did see a significant momentum shift, though. After winning the pistol round but dropping the anti-eco, FNATIC dropped seven straight rounds, allowing for their American opponents to tie things up and then take the lead. Cloud9's double-Controller, and double-Initiator composition helped them put one foot forward on attack, while Duelist OXY heated up when his team needed him most. A momentum-snatching ace for OXY. A timeout after going down for the first time from head coach Elmapuddy appeared to inspire his team, as they put on a flawless round to knot things at 11, but Cloud9 would not stumble. They closed out a near-perfect attack half, outscoring Fnatic 10-2 with nine rounds being by way of eliminating all five of their opponents. Alfajer put on a stellar performance in the losing effort, with nine of his 21 kills being first-bloods. \"Honestly, holy moly,\" OXY said after the match. \"That is actually crazy, I don't even know what just happened. 3-10 comeback? Was it 3-9? Jesus.\" Team Heretics and Cloud9 will eagerly await the later results of Thursday's slate of games. They will be drawn against fellow 1-0 teams that leave the opening round victorious, while FOKUS and FNATIC will wait to see who loses."

    "cleaned_content": "“I think [we're] starting a little slow, but I think it's because we're taking the right way and making sure we have long term success.” Daniel \" Rossy \" Abedrabbo , who spent last year overseas under the T1 banner, has finally returned home to the Americas after signing with Cloud9 . Despite being picked up after his team qualified for Red Bull Home Ground through the Seattle LAN, the new in-game leader displayed confidence and trust in his team ahead of one of the biggest OFF//SEASON events of the year. “I think being under Autumn and my teammates [at T1]... taught me a lot of balance and [I] understood how to be a better person. Without that experience, I would not be able to lead this team or be able to do anything that well coming back home to America.” noted Rossy when prompted about his time with his former team. Rossy helped take T1 to their only international event of the year. (Photo: Lee Aiksoon/Riot Games) “If you look at our roster, firepower and stuff like that is not an issue at all… A lot of [our results] will be based upon our chemistry and how we want to play the game together. I know, not think, I know that these guys are all fantastic players. They're all going to have great individual seasons.” Cloud9 has gone through changes this year, with players shuffling in and out throughout many portions of the season. Most recently, the team bid farewell to vanity and runi before signing Rossy and former Moist x Shopify player v1c . The new roster took home the trophy at the Seattle Qualifier , but exited the SEN City Classic winless. “After we played in SEN City, we lost every game, but we learned what's actually good and what's not good. We want to focus on recurring issues and fixing those. We use these OFF//SEASON events to really learn about what our true strengths and weaknesses are… Obviously we want to win and we're not just there to practice, but overall it's a learning experience.” Rossy also spoke on Immi and GUGLi , the two coaches on the team who seldom received time under the spotlights. The two have helped Cloud9 prepare and practice throughout the VCT season and ahead of a new year. “They have a really good dynamic between Coach and Assistant Coach. Truthfully, they do very well and work off each other very well. They also have their own strengths and know how to divvy up the work to make sure that everyone is doing what they need to do. They keep us on the same page at all times.” Surprisingly, there seemed to be an absence of teams that Rossy had set his sights on. The in-game leader displayed calmness and indifference to his potential opponents. “There isn't anyone I'm looking forward to play… whoever God decides we need to play we need to play. Obviously there's T1 and I think it would be fun to play against some of my former teammates and friends. Whoever we play is whoever we play.” However, there were two teams that certainly seemed a cut above the rest to him. When asked about which rosters looked the scariest, Rossy immediately listed two powerhouses. “I think Team Heretics is the easy pick here. Heretics and FNATIC in my opinion. I think FNATIC's playing with their original roster and Sayonara . That Sayonara guy looks really good… Heretics and FNATIC look really scary.” As for which teams seemed easiest to beat, Rossy couldn't seem to come up with any. “Uh, I don't know. Maybe us. Maybe us.” he laughed. “Maybe we'll be easy to beat. Those are all good teams, I truly don't believe anyone is easy.” Rossy's attitude towards the OFF//SEASON events may seem lax, but his overall thought process behind it put his perspective of the event into one of practice and improvement. “You can't really put a lot of stock into it; I think it's so hard to tell. Last year, Heretics and Gen.G were the two best teams, and both struggled in the OFF//SEASON. Heretics played back to back events and lost, Gen.G lost to FUT Esports in Convergence . Obviously there are teams like Sentinels who did good and had a really great year.” “If you [think] ‘this OFF//SEASON event is gonna make or break us,' I think that's a little bit interesting and I don't think that I agree with that.” Overall, Rossy seemed prepared and ready to put the work ahead of the 2025 VCT. His attitude and demeanor displayed confidence and understanding of his team's position this year. “I'm blessed to be here and have this opportunity to play on C9 and I hope that I can lead them to a great year and maybe break the Cloud9 regular season curse and actually make an international event with these guys.” Good luck, Rossy! (Photo: David Lee/Riot Games) “We know we're good. Any day we can come up and just beat anyone, but it's just about being consistent; being consistently good every single day. But that just comes with practice. We might be ready right now, we might not. We're a pretty young team and are just going with it. We're not looking too deep into the future or the past, just focusing on the current moment. We're definitely improving every day and that's all that matters right now.” Cloud9 will face FNATIC today in their opening match of the fifth annual Red Bull Home Ground, a rematch of last year's grand finals."

Entering the 2024 season with three rookies, a fourth player who played only one tier-one match in 2023, and poor offseason results, Heretics was expected by many to rank towards the bottom of EMEA.

The 2024 season saw teams like FNATIC and Paper Rex unable to replicate their 2023 heights on the international stage despite impressive domestic performances. “A problem that I believe that FNATIC had for this year, at least at the start of the year, maybe is that they were scared of experimenting a bit,” Benjamin \" benjyfishy \" David Fish commented. “We were changing comps so many times throughout the season and I think that's why we were so good. We're very experimental and I think that's why we're also going to do good next year.” He also doesn't believe that the experience Heretics gained this year will stifle their motivation or their identity as a young and hungry team. “All of us still have the hunger to want to win and the hunger to play and grind and everything you need to be champions, but we've also got that experience that young players don't have on big stages…so I only see it as a good thing that we got all the experience this year.” Although confident, the team isn't feeling any pressure to perform right away in Red Bull. “If we lose, we lose,” benjyfishy said. “Naturally people are going to have high standards for us, but we never put expectations on ourselves; we never take outside views or outside perspectives.” Looking ahead to the event, benjyfishy is hoping to face T1 , who qualified by winning the APAC Play-ins . “I love stax , and I love the players in T1, carpe as well,” he said. “I'm a very big fan of the org in general and I never got a chance to play them last year.” As for the 2025 season, things like expectations or winning it all haven't even crossed his mind. “I like to try and live in the present, and right now all I'm focused on is what I've got to do today.” “Maybe when I come back to Berlin in like two months for the season…but for now, I'm playing, I'm practicing, I'm trying to work on myself, get better as a player, as a person, and hopefully this event will help [me] do that.” benjyfishy and the rest of Heretics will play their first match of the offseason on Nov. 21 in approximately eight hours against FOKUS in the Red Bull Home Ground main event ."

ALL PLATFORMS NEW ARMOR Regen Shield We want to expand the strategic and tactical possibilities within the VALORANT competitive sandbox by introducing a new defensive option.Regen Shield has been added to the shop. Cost: 650 Credits Damage Absorption: 25 HP Regeneration Pool: 50 HP Absorbs 100% of incoming damage taken before damage to health occurs. After a brief delay, the shield regenerates by draining any remaining points left in the Regeneration Pool. AGENT UPDATES Cypher Cypher has been a dominant force with his map-wide information gathering and powerful kill setups. Because Cypher's map-wide info is intended to be his unique strength, we want to target the efficacy of his kill potential. We're adjusting the Trap Wire to increase the counterplay time window after hitting it, so that there is more of a balance between a well-crafted setup and enemies deliberately trying to break trap wires. Additionally, this will help team compositions who don't have as much utility to deal with unbreakable traps. Cypher's ultimate has been extra powerful after adding the second reveal and the removal of time restriction on enemy corpses in patch 5.10, so we're bumping up the cost to put it more in-line with other comparable ultimates. Trap Wire: Now has a .5 second windup before the full wallhack reveal applies and fades in. Trap wire now has updated minimap icon treatment to better display what the trap wire is connected to. Neural Theft: Ult Cost 6 >>> 7 Sage Sage has been feeling weak with relatively low pick rate in high-level play. We want to continue to hone in her ability to stall and slow down attackers when pushing into areas her team controls. With the added dash speed reduction on Slowing Orb, well-timed, proactive casts of her Slowing Orb should feel rewarding and make slows a more meaningful debuff against duelists with dashes. Healing Orb: Self Heal 30HP >>> 50HP Heal time matched to ally heal at around 5 seconds Slowing Orb: Now will additionally reduce the dash speed of enemies caught inside the slowing zone by 50% similar to the Concuss changes in the Gameplay Systems Updates later in the patch notes. Resurrection: Ult Cost 8 >>> 7 Deadlock Deadlock's ultimate will now always kill the target when the timer expires and they are not freed from the nanowire cocoon. Previously, captured targets only died if they reached the end location before the timer expired. Deadlock's visuals for health on the Annihilation Cocoon and Barrier Mesh have been updated to make their health states more clear. Omen Omen has been a mainstay controller in high-level play for a long time. He particularly shines in his ability to create ambiguity throughout a round with the low cooldowns on his smokes. However, Omen's ability to place one-way smokes inside level geometry provides significant defensive power with low counterplay. We'll be keeping an eye out here for how these changes affect the overall controller ecosystem. Dark Cover: Dark Cover will now always fall to level geometry where players can stand similar to other spherical smokes like Brimstone's Sky Smoke, Clove's Ruse, etc. This should prevent Omen from placing one-way smokes on small ornamental pieces of geometry, like the fuse boxes in the main of Split B and only allow him to place smokes where players can stand. Clove Ruse: Ally vs enemy clarity around Ruse casts for both alive and dead casts of smokes have been improved. Enemy smokes updated to appear more red than ally smokes Not Dead Yet: Time to get a kill: 12s >>> 10s This change had been made accidentally in Patch 8.11 when fixing another bug, but the ultimate has been performing well at this tuning. Phoenix Following up from our updates to Duelist in 8.11, we're taking an opportunity to let Phoenix shine brighter as the bold and confident duelist he is. His updates encourage him to get back to the fight quickly, break into sites with his Curve Ball and reward him for succeeding on entry. Phoenix now applies a Heal over time to himself whenever he touches his flames which persists even if he leaves the fire. This allows him to dip into his flames and then continue to press the offense. Curve Ball: Changed to the signature ability slot Grants a free charge on round start 2 kill reset to generate an additional charge Hot Hands: Changed to a non-signature ability Cost 200 credits Blaze: We want to support Phoenix's hybrid “jack of all trades” utility value by allowing him to cast Blaze from safety for his teammates similar to other vision-blocking utility. Initial projectile goes through walls, allowing Blaze to function similarly to Harbor's High Tide. Jett Drift (Passive) Balance-impacting bug fix: Jett can no longer float while suppressed or detained. WEAPONS UPDATES We're making some tuning adjustments to weapons. As VALORANT has grown and evolved, you all have learned how to take advantage of different methods of swinging and peeking. Because of the way bullet tagging in VALORANT works (slowing down when shots land on you), shot players are often tagged and then slowed down into the walking state and as a result their weapons become quickly more accurate. We want to maintain this intuitive relationship between player movement speed and accuracy, so we're opting to increase all moving state accuracy penalties (AKA “movement error”) and encourage intentionality in movement when shooting. The Sheriff and the Frenzy already have different movement error inaccuracies compared to the other pistols, which are valuable to maintain for the sake of their identities. SMGs are unaffected, as we believe that their mobile accuracy is a core part of how the weapons are unique within the arsenal. The Ghost having more bullets than the Frenzy didn't make intuitive sense given their unique strength and weakness profiles amongst the pistols. Pistols All Pistols (except the shorty) Moving while crouching Inaccuracy: .1 >>> .5 Classic Right Click Running Inaccuracy: 1.3 >>> 1.5 Right Click Burst Jumping Inaccuracy: 2.1 >>> 2.25 Walking Inaccuracy: 0.84 >>> 1.1 Run Inaccuracy: 2 >>> 2.3 Frenzy Bullet Count Increased 13 >>> 15 Ghost Walking Inaccuracy: 0.84 >>> 1.1 Run Inaccuracy: 2 >>> 2.3 Bullet Count Reduced 15 >>> 13 Rifles All Rifles Walk Inaccuracy: 2 >>> 3 Run Inaccuracy: 5 >> 6 Machine Guns All Machine Guns Walk Inaccuracy: 2.4 >>> 3 Run Inaccuracy: 6 >>> 6.5 Phantom There have been fewer Phantom purchases over time with new maps being released and higher proficiency in shooting. The Phantom and Vandal's current differences are intended to keep their identities unique while still being relatively competitive with each other. These changes are intended to make the Phantom feel better to use primarily and reduce frustrating instances of headshots doing less damage than expected at different distances. These breakpoints will remove some instances of 140 headshots and all instances of 124 in 1 headshots (excluding wall penetration). Damage fall-off changed: Previously: 39 damage per bullet (0 - 15m) 35 damage per bullet (15 - 30m) 31 damage per bullet (30m+) Now: 39 damage per bullet (0 - 20m) 35 damage per bullet (20m+) MAP UPDATES Sunset We updated global lighting for the entire map. Players should see an improvement in lighting quality and general visibility in previously darker portions of the map. GAMEPLAY SYSTEMS UPDATES The changes to the gameplay systems in this patch are to better support VALORANT's tactical gameplay. The combat report is intended to share in-game information easily. We're always paying attention to how these systems are playing out, including ways that those systems can be used to create advantages that are counter to their intended use cases. Combat Report While the combat report should be a tool to provide gameplay context for what your impact was within a round of VALORANT, it has the occasional downside of leaking information to you that you otherwise would have had no way of knowing. This happens most often with utility, such as Breach's Flashpoint or Skye's Guiding Light: You use your utility and get killed, but inadvertently also discover you blinded players you never saw or engaged with. With these kinds of cases in mind, we're making a change to the Combat Report: Your utility usage statistics now appear once the round has resolved rather than immediately upon death. In its place, you will see an animated hourglass. Once the round ends, utility usage statistics will become available and persist through pre-round of the next round. Concusses Well-placed concusses should be just as consequential for our movement-oriented Duelists as other agents. We also think this strengthens defensive teleports compared to dashes as more flexible repositioning options to compensate for their weakness in entry capabilities. Concusses now slow enemy dashes by 50% This affects Jett's Tailwind and Neon's Slide. Overheal UI Visual Update We've updated the way we show overheal shields in the bottom HUD to improve legibility. This affects how we show bonus HP after using Reyna's Devour and Clove's Pick-Me-Up. Smoke Visual Update Visual cues have been added to the inside of the smoke to let you know when they are about to disappear to better support decision making. These cues match up with the ones that exist on the outside of the smoke. The following Agents' smokes have been affected: Astra Brimstone Omen Clove BUG FIXES Agents Killjoy Fixed a bug with Alarm Bot where it did not play the proper reactivation ceremony and would instantly reactivate when Killjoy reentered its range. Clove Fixed a bug where Meddle was hitting through level geometry. Maps Fixed an issue where ambient audio elements were not playing pre-round for Pearl, Breeze, and Sunset. PC PREMIER UPDATES Added a visual divider on Invite Division standings that shows the cutoff for demotion at the end of Stage E9A3. Teams below the divider after standings finalize will be demoted at the start of the next Stage. Added a message that notifies you if your team has qualified for playoffs. The first time you return to the Premier hub after your team has met the qualification requirements, you'll see the message. Added a Contender Eligibility expiration date on the Premier tab of the Career page. Contender Eligibility for 2024 expires at the end of Stage E9A3. To be Contender Eligible in 2025, you and your team must perform a qualifying action in Stage E9A3 or at any point in 2025. Qualifying actions include: Play a Weekly or Playoff match on a team in Contender or Invite Division. Reach Immortal 3 or higher peak rank in Competitive. Play in a Playoff match in Elite 5. CLIENT UPDATES Added QR Code Login feature for Riot Client using Riot Mobile App If you log in to VALORANT through the Riot Client, you can now scan a QR Code and log in through the Riot Mobile App. No more typing in your Riot ID and password - open Riot Mobile, scan the code, and you're in. Learn more about Riot Mobile here . BUG FIXES Premier Fixed an issue where games in a best of 3 match were all listed as finals in Premier match history. Games are now correctly listed as Game 1, Game 2, or Game 3. Console BUG FIXES Agents Fixed an issue where sensitivity is severely reduced when using Jett and Raze ultimate abilities until engaging Focus."

    "cleaned_content": "TSM has announced their rebuilt roster ahead of Split 3 of NA Challengers 2024. Tyler \" sym \" Porter returns as a starter alongside former QoR members Travis \" tdawgg \" Regan and Damion \" XXiF \" Cook . After fighting their way through the Open Qualifiers of NA Challengers, tdawwg and XXiF managed to secure a spot alongside the many other seasoned talents of North America. Under QoR, the duo took on Group A of Split 1 and managed to advance to the Mid Season Cup , where they finished among the top eight. Unfortunately, the team could not replicate their previous results in Split 2 and consequently finished dead last in Group A, just barely avoiding Relegation by one placement. From there, tdawwg and XXiF would eventually part ways with the organization in search of new opportunities. After missing out on 2023's Americas: Ascension by falling to its eventual winners, sym departed Moist Moguls and attempted to fight his way through the 2024 Challengers Open Qualifiers with Lemonade Stand . Unfortunately, his time with the team did not generate much success in the moment, but his skills landed him a spot on TSM, who were intent on making a deep run throughout Challengers. Despite never being in contention of making 2024's Americas: Ascension , TSM waited patiently with their heads down and bided their time throughout Challengers. The squad advanced to the next stage of Split 2's with a 3-3 record in Groups, and began preparing for the qualification playoffs. After initially falling to M80 , TSM faced an early finish to their year in the lower bracket. However, intent on booking tickets to Brazil, the team struck down SaD Esports and Blinn before upsetting Oxygen Esports and Moist x Shopify to secure North America's second seed at Ascension. Unfortunately, TSM's story seemed to end with that final achievement. The team picked up a single win on Mexico's stage against Galorys before bombing out of playoffs with a 1-4 record. Shortly after, the organization released sym, Kevin \" POISED \" Ngo , Alex \" aproto \" Protopapas , as well as Head Coach Daniel \" Faded \" Hwang and began preparing for Split 3. Now, TSM seem hungry for more than just an appearance at Ascension and aim to showcase their new roster ahead of the 2025 VCT. TSM is now: Johann \" seven \" Hernandez Anthony \" gMd \" Guimond Tyler \" sym \" Porter Travis \" tdawgg \" Regan Damion \" XXiF \" Cook"

    "cleaned_content": "Capping off a dominant Game Changers 2024 Championship that did not see them drop a single map, Shopify Rebellion Gold defeated MIBR GC 3-0 to claim their second-straight GCC trophy. The best-of-five series played itself out on three maps on Pearl, Sunset, and Haven. Shopify Rebellion picked Pearl and Haven, while MIBR picked Sunset and Abyss. Having entered this match from the upper bracket, Shopify Rebellion had the double map ban, and chose to avoid Split and Bind. Shopify Rebellion won Pearl 13-7, Sunset 13-7, and Haven 13-11 while Abyss and Ascent, MIBR's second pick and the decider, were unnecessary. Almost a year to the day after acquiring the Version1 roster, Shopify Rebellion has won their second international championship with the same core. Beginning on the attack side of Pearl, MIBR had the opportunity to set the tempo on not just the map, but the series. Duelist florescent threw the first punch of the series though, racking up seven kills in the first two rounds by way of her Sheriff and her Outlaw to collect ultimate points early. Three shots, four kills for florescent. Shopify Rebellion's double-Initiator team composition offered them plenty of information on the large two-site map, offering an entertaining clash with the double-Controller composition of MIBR. On a map as large as Pearl which requires so much time to rotate, SR carried the advantage heading into the second half. Moments of heroics from alexis pushed them to map point, and SR wrapped things up two rounds later. A huge 3K for SR alexis to cap off a retake and reach map point. Shifting to Sunset, Shopify Rebellion rode their momentum from Pearl. Now beginning on the attack side, the key to the map appeared to be doing what they were good at. florescent ended the map with a 24-kill performance. Ten of those kills were first-bloods for the entry frag. After switching sides and losing the pistol, anti-eco, and bonus rounds, MIBR threatened to snowball their way into a comeback. They cut a six-round halftime lead in half and carried five rifles into the next round, but walked their way into a SR-shaped trap. Four shots, three kills this time for florescent. The rest of Sunset was smooth sailing for Shopify Rebellion. They never trailed in the map after dropping the first two rounds of the map, and built on their 9-3 halftime lead to go up 2-0. The third map of the series, Haven, was a map that MIBR was yet to play at GCC, while Shopify Rebellion has played it twice before. After winning the pistol and anti-eco rounds with relative ease, MIBR dropped their bonus round, but bounced back to claim a 3-1 lead. With momentum building, SR seemed to have a clear read on their opponents and put a stop to that run, claiming a round thanks to an impressive show of mechanics from Sentinel player Noia . MIBR play their ways into a Noia ace. Down five rounds to three with their opponents carrying a healthy economy into the next round, MIBR forced SR head coach effys to call a timeout to regroup his team. Whatever was said in the timeout appeared to have worked, as Shopify won two of the next four rounds to grab five in the defense half of a generally attack-sided map. After ending the first halves of the first two maps with 9-3 leads, SR had ground to make up on Haven, facing a 7-5 deficit once the teams switched sides. Victories in the pistol and anti-eco rounds quickly returned the map to a deadlock, and while they did drop the bonus, they entered it with a flourishing economy. After razor-thin margins between the teams kept them tied or within two rounds of each other for the rest of the second half, they continued to build a strong economy. A hero buy Vandal from MIBR duelist srN was not enough to stop the bleeding in the 22nd round, and SR found series point. While MIBR clawed one back, it was goodnight from Berlin soon after. A florescent 4K to end GCC 24. Storybook ending? Shopify Rebellion lifts not just their second-straight Game Changers Championship trophy, but their second straight in dominant fashion. In last year's competition, they did so without dropping just three maps. They outdid themselves in this year's competition, not dropping a single map and capping another unbeaten GCC campaign. Superstar duelist florescent dropped 74 kills and an ACS of 317, both server-highs while MIBR duelist srN had a team-high 44. Florescent won the GCC MVP award unanimously, earning 100 percent of the votes in the process. “I'm happy, it looks nice,” florescent said after receiving the bracelet awarded for earning the accolade. “I thought I'd just play ranked for the rest of my life, so this is pretty nice,” she said. Shortly after, she spoke to the mic, drawing “oohs” from the Berlin crowd. “I just want to play against the best of the best always cause it's the most fun,” she said, teasing the possibility of playing outside of Game Changers in the near future. When asked what her dream in professional Valorant was, she responded: “I don't know, probably just like, go to Champs and go to a bunch of events and meet a bunch of cool people.” “I'm honestly incredibly proud,” effys said after the match. “Not just now but the entire past few months, I just think everybody's just gone on they've played between like eight and 12 hours and not complained at all. So yeah, right now I'm proud. Win or lose I would have been proud regardless.”"

LockM began his professional Valorant career in 2022 with Weibo Gaming , and found himself on Griffin E-Sports , JiJieHao , and Night Wings Gaming before landing on TEC's roster ahead of the 2024 season. He has been an Initiator player for most of his career, but has also played the Controller role on dual-Controller team compositions. With LockM in 2024, TEC fell far short of any lofty expectations. A promising start at China Kickoff saw them fall short of the playoffs by being eliminated in the play-ins, but they never returned to that form. Through China Stage 1 and Stage 2 they totaled just three victories, and nine maps. Mid-season changes saw the team part ways with players shameless and QiuYe and shifted assistant coach York to a player role, though he would never take the stage. Since the end of the season, they have parted ways with York, and signed Haodong as a player and AfteR as their coach. The pair joined from Champions -winning EDward Gaming , where Haodong played a behind-the-scenes role in coaching after his benching, while After was in an inactive role since June. In the 2024 OFF//SEASON, TEC has participated in the WALL-E Cup , achieving a last-placed 7th-8th place finish, and the FGC Invitational , where they finished 7th-8th in a field of 10.

    "cleaned_content": "With a 3-0 scoreline, MIBR GC has defeated G2 Gozen , eliminating the former champions from contention and advancing to the Game Changers 2024 Championship grand final . MIBR will next face off against defending champions Shopify Rebellion, seeking Brazil's first-ever title at the premier Game Changers event. The series was a rematch of an earlier game, where G2 Gozen defeated MIBR 2-1 on their way through the upper bracket. G2 is no stranger to Brazilian lineups, however, as they defeated Team Liquid Brazil in the 2023 upper bracket but lost 2-0 in the lower final. In the map veto, G2 Gozen banned first, taking away their permaban and one of MIBR's better maps , Ascent. MIBR, meanwhile, opted to ban Split, a map which they lost 13-8 to G2 earlier this event. This veto left Abyss, which MIBR has played once since its release, and Sunset, which G2 has not lost in the last five months, as Gozen's picks. MIBR chose Bind, in which they've only lost once in the last two months and defeated G2 13-8, and Haven, where they boast a better record but have not played since August. Pearl remained as the decider map, only the second time MIBR has played the map in 2024 and the first for G2 this season. Abyss kicked off the lower final. The international débutantes quickly shut down the attack's pistol round, but Gozen was quick to respond, winning the eco and anti-eco to recover from the pistol loss. MIBR recovered on the bonus round, taking the lead 4-3 and forcing out their opponent's timeout. G2 won their second thrifty to tie the score, and mimi punished a hesitant defense the next round, leading to a pause from the Brazilian squad ahead of round 10. The timeout helped MIBR adapt, as they tied the score and sent the map to halftime at 6-6. srN forces G2 to save with their attacking Jett Operator The pendulum continued swinging in the second half, as Gozen broke the tie in the pistol round with a Vania clutch. MIBR regained the lead after testing the defense, slowly whittling down the opposition to set the score 9-8. G2 was quick to adapt, recognizing a fake in time to counter MIBR's game plan. An ult-heavy round 19 pushed MIBR into the double digits, and they took advantage of the eco round to extend their lead. MIBR kept applying pressure, switching sites and alternating pace to avoid round losses, closing out the map 13-9. Bind , MIBR's map pick, started off well for the South American lineup. Their reads and early picks helped deny any plan from the attack and put MIBR up 4-0. It wasn't until G2's tactical timeout that they were able to get on the scoreboard, but their two round wins were not enough to break through their defense. srN was instrumental in the half, but sayuri's performance made the difference. Statistically, the in-game leader went to halftime with a 2.11 rating, 17-4 kill-death ratio, and a clutch under her belt. MIBR makes it look easy. The second half was more favorable for the former champions, thanks in part to their unusual defensive trap plays. Gozen was able to take four rounds in a row before an MIBR timeout was called. Despite their recent success, a misplayed round from G2 led to MIBR's first offensive round win and Gozen's own timeout to prevent match point. The round came down to the wire, with sayuri denying a 1v4 clutch from her Danish counterpart. rezq and amy were crucial the next few rounds, their multikills supported by mimi 's Fault Lines. On the other side, srN and sayuri did everything to keep their team in the game, and a pause was enough to push Bind over the line, ending MIBR's map 13-10 and leaving the Brazilian representatives at series point. MIBR continued their momentum for Sunset , taking advantage of their attacking half to take a pacey approach. sayuri confirmed the bonus round in her team's favor with a 3K, forcing G2 to play their second eco round early in the half. A timeout put Gozen on the board, but MIBR remained unfazed. Petra did her best to keep her team in the game, but melissa and jubs closed out their clutches to further extend their lead. srN continued their dominance for the last round of the half, completely taking over impossible duels to grant her team the site and an 11th round win. srN finds a quick 4K In the end, Mel and srN sealed the final two rounds, ending G2 Gozen's run with a 13-1 win and qualifying to the grand final in their first international appearance. In-game leader sayuri and srN were by far the standout players, statistically. srN led the server with a dominant 70 eliminations and 22 first kills, while sayuri scored the highest rating of the server at 1.51, ended +22 in kills vs. deaths, and won four clutches. “I'm proud of my whole team,” jubs said after the series. “We are making history.” The victory means that Brazil will play against North America for the GCC title for the second year in a row, with MIBR equalling Team Liquid Brazil's 2023 achievement. In a similar vein, G2 Gozen, the inaugural Game Changers champions, has been eliminated in third place for the second year in a row, this time on home soil. The organization will need another year if they wish to reclaim the trophy they first won back in 2022. jubs was confident about their next match. “We're pretty comfortable with this streak of energy,” she said. “It's going to be a very good game for us.”"

    "cleaned_content": "In a back-and-forth affair, MIBR GC defeated Xipto Esports GC 2-1 to reach the lower final, sending the Pacific champions home with a fourth-placed finish. After surviving elimination the day before, the two regional champions met, fighting for the chance to play in the lower final. The three-map series was played out on Bind, Split, and Sunset with Bind being MIBR's map pick, Split being Xipto's map pick and Sunset being the decider. MIBR won Bind 13-4, Xipto won Split 13-6, and MIBR won Sunset 13-5. MIBR made Bind, their map pick, look easy. Their attack half was well-coordinated and dominant, building an 11-1 lead heading into halftime. Three different MIBR players were fragging in double digits, with duelist srN again leading the way. Playing on Raze, she ended the map with a server-leading 19 kills. As the sides changed, the tides seemed to turn, too. Xipto converted their attacking pistol, anti-eco, and bonus rounds with great teamplay, setting themselves up with a good economy both in the bank and with their ultimate abilities. The momentum swing died, however, on the anti-eco following that bonus. srN makes this Sheriff 3K look easy. The following round exemplified MIBR's continued dominance, playing into their team organization and composition's strengths, pulling off a 4v5 retake. Through Bind, MIBR had allowed just seven rounds across the past three maps. Split, the map that Xipto most recently had defeated FlyQuest RED on, started as almost a mirror of Bind, except it was a different team on top. Xipto jumped out to an 8-1 lead, forcing MIBR head coach Biscoit1n to burn both of his timeouts in just the first half. The high-speed Xipto attack was highlighted by its double-duelist composition. With enerii on Neon and Alexy on Raze, they had little to no trouble taking space on their attacking half. The double-headed Xipto monster of enerii and Alexy. Carrying a 9-3 lead into halftime, Xipto won four of the next seven rounds, turning around a muted map one performance to force a third map, looking for back-to-back comeback victories. The day before, they defeated KRÜ BLAZE after losing the first map 13-6. While srN didn't enjoy her usual dominance on Split, she got back into her groove on Sunset. That momentum was heralded by an ace, assisted by teammate Jelly . By the time the round was over, srN was halfway to her next Raze ult already. The map started back and forth with the first four rounds split evenly, but quietly and quickly ballooned into an 8-4 halftime deficit. Sunset, the map that MIBR defeated ZETA DIVISION GC 13-3 just the day before, continued to be a dominant one for the Brazilian team. A late 4K for Initiator player sayuri helped MIBR to reach match point, and they'd seal the series two rounds later, winning 13-5. “I always try to keep calm,” sayuri said after the match. “I see I'm not killing anyone? It's okay! I'm giving the support at least, and the calls at least.” While srN didn't have the dominant 29-kill performance that she did against ZETA on Sunset, she had a leaderboard-topping 20 kills, including a server-leading six first-bloods. Across all three maps, she also had 53 total kills and 279 ACS, which led the server, while Xipto's Alexy had 44 kills to lead her team. With elimination, Xipto finishes GCC 24 in fourth place for the second year in a row, matching the result that they had as Team SMG GC in GCC 23 . Meanwhile, MIBR continues their campaign and has earned themselves a rematch with G2 Gozen in the best-of-five lower final. G2 Gozen knocked MIBR down into the lower bracket when they met in the upper semifinal, and are coming off of a 2-0 loss to Shopify Rebellion Gold ."

Shopify now advances to the grand final , while G2 has been sent down to the lower final and will face the winner of Xipto Esports GC versus MIBR GC to determine who will challenge Shopify for the crown. The two-map series played out on Abyss and Haven, Abyss being G2's pick and Haven being Shopify's pick. Shopify won Abyss 17-15 and Haven 14-12. This matchup of juggernauts was a rematch of the upper final of last year's Game Changers Championship , where Shopify won 2-1. However, the tale of this matchup extends even further back to 2022, where G2 defeated meL and alexis when they were part of Cloud9 White . “Last year we finally got them,” meL said in the pre-match teaser . “This one's to settle the score.” The series kicked off on G2's map pick of Abyss. While Shopify was last seen playing Vyse on the map in North America, this time they opted to mirror G2's more standard composition featuring Jett and KAY/O. Shopify opened up an early 6-1 lead off of the back of unstoppable site hits, but a chaotic Sheriff thrifty win in round 8 and an outrageous no-scope Operator shot from rezq in round 9 brought G2 back into the game, narrowing the gap to a 7-5 lead in favor of Shopify at the half. Crisp Sheriff shots give G2 a way back in (with some help from the environment). The second half began with another Shopify pistol win as the North American squad extended their lead to 10-6. Once again, G2 fought back; a 1v3 from rezq in round 17 kept them in the map and a tense 1v1 from Vania in round 24 brought it to overtime. Overtime was a string of constant attack round wins for both sides, but Shopify finally took the long-awaited defense round in the end to win Abyss 17-15. florescent topped the scoreboard with 33 kills, 10 of which were first kills, a 1.37 rating, and 189 ADR, while meL trailed close behind with 25 kills and a rating of 1.21. The next map, Haven, featured another standard mirror matchup as both teams went for Neon-Breach compositions. G2 carried the first pistol to a 4-1 start on their defense, featuring a sharp amy ace in round 5 to avoid a potential thrifty. Shopify answered back with a hard-fought B postplant in round 6 with G2, carrying the momentum to equalize at 4-4. The first half ended at 6-6 after a continued back-and-forth battle. amy stands tall on the C site and takes down Shopify on her own. The two teams stayed neck-and-neck for the rest of the match. Every attempt at breaking away by either team was met with a swift answer; G2 winning the second pistol was countered by Shopify's early buy round wins to keep score tied at 8-8. G2 won a thrifty in round 18 with a 1v2 clutch from amy, but Shopify immediately won a thrifty of their own thanks to a 4K from Noia . It seemed that G2 had finally found stable footing in round 22 when rezq aced with Neon's Overdrive ultimate to take her team up to 12-10. However, Shopify rallied with strong site holds to secure yet another overtime. This time, Shopify ended overtime quickly, demonstrating clean, coordinated plays to take Haven 14-12 and the series 2-0. Experience and teamplay bring Shopify over the line. Statistically, both Cypher players dominated the server. amy ended the map with an impressive 1.47 rating, 29 kills, and 186 ADR, while Noia followed with a 1.35 rating, 25 kills, and 157 ADR. This victory sets Shopify up for an opportunity at winning back-to-back Game Changers championships as they reach the grand final without dropping a map. “I think we just try our best to have fun,” sarahcat said regarding her team in the post-match interview. “The more fun you have, the easier it is to win, the less nervous you are.” Shopify Rebellion will return in the grand final on Nov. 17 with a double map ban advantage. G2 Gozen will next play in the lower final on Nov. 16."

    "cleaned_content": "In a meeting between regional powerhouses, Xipto Esports GC eliminated KRÜ BLAZE , securing a top-four finish in GCC Berlin in the process. The three-map series was played out on Haven and Abyss, with Haven being KRÜ's map pick, Abyss being Xipto's, and Pearl being the decider. KRÜ won Haven 13-6, Xipto won Abyss 13-10, and Xipto won Pearl 13-9. On Haven, KRÜ's defense half was highlighted by early-round aggression which rewarded them with map control. A lobby, C long, and mid were dominated by the Chilean team for much of the first half. Early aggression was always going to be key in a Neon-versus-Neon matchup, and KRÜ's balance of eagerness to fight and patience gave them an 8-4 advantage as they shifted to attack. KRÜ thrived in A Lobby and A Long. The aggression on defense translated well to attack. KRÜ dropped just two rounds in the second half, cruising to a 13-6 win. KRÜ Duelist dods , who currently has the highest total kills at GCC 24, ended the map with 17 kills, while Sentinel player romi ended with a server-high 20. Xipto took to Abyss with an attack-sided team composition. With no Sentinel and opting for a double Controller look, they boasted a lineup of agents that had plenty of post-plant utility. Post-plant play made the attack half a smooth one for Xipto. Astra's Gravity Well, Brimstone's Incendiary and Orbital Strike, KAY/O's FRAG/ment, and Sova's Shock Bolt and Hunter's Fury gave Xipto not just a luxury of options in the post-plant but also plenty of damage-dealing utility to earn them space. The impact of dods, whose best work has come on Neon in this competition, was minimized on Abyss. She had a server-low rating of 0.76, playing on Jett. Back on Neon, Pearl was an opportunity for her to bounce back. Xipto again fielded a zero-Sentinel composition, featuring a double Controller, double Duelist look with Alexy on Jett. If there was any indication that Pearl was going to be a back-and-forth affair, look no further than how it started. The two sides traded the first three rounds, with the fourth being more topsy-turvy than the three that preceded it. A Xipto round! Or... A KRÜ round?! No team won more than three rounds in a row in the second half. That was until Xipto snowballed momentum towards the end of the map, clinching four straight, making their 8-4 halftime advantage all the more valuable. Kamiyu continued her red-hot form into Xipto's attack half. Xipto Initiator player Kamiyu , playing on Fade, had quite possibly her best map of GCC 24, ending with a game-high 29 kills as part of a server-leading 59-kill performance. Following a short-lived run in the lower bracket that saw them eliminate GIANTX GC , KRÜ bow out of the GCC in the 5th-6th position for the second year in a row after being eliminated by the current Xipto core of Team SMG GC last year. After suffering their first defeat in 21 matches across regional, continental and international play, Xipto bounced back and survived. They secured a top-four finish and will play MIBR GC in the lower semifinal. This is their second-straight top-four finish after achieving a fourth-place finish as Team SMG GC in 2023."

    "cleaned_content": "On a day that they could seemingly do no wrong, MIBR GC bounced back and eliminated ZETA DIVISION GC , giving up just three rounds across the 2-0 victory and setting history. Thursday's two-map series was played out on Ascent and Sunset, with Ascent being ZETA's map pick and Sunset being MIBR's. MIBR dominated Ascent 13-0 and clinched Sunset 13-3. ZETA's first full buy round appeared to be an opportunity for them to strike. Two early picks gave them the entirety of the A site with no fallen members. However, a wonderfully orchestrated retake saw MIBR win the bonus and begin to snowball. Jelly 's 3K on MIBR's 3v5 retake was the map's HyperX Reflex Moment. MIBR could do no wrong on Ascent. All the while, it appeared as though the ZETA players couldn't find their footing. Several ZETA attack rounds seemed unlosable that they'd dropped. There were also several that saw them let the clock dwindle too low, resulting in them — on a defense-sided map — playing into the MIBR defense's hands. sayuri 's 3K got MIBR one step closer to 13-0. The round, which was ZETA's fifth full buy round of the game, was followed by MIBR converting on the sixth, and then clinching the pistol round to open the second half and close the map. It's the first 13-0 map victory in the history of GCC. sayuri , playing on Omen, went 14-3 on the map, while Duelist srN 's operator was online for most of the map thanks to the team's flourishing economy. After losing their map pick in sweeping fashion, ZETA had to make up lost ground on the second map, Sunset. They'd clinch their first round of the match, but not before dropping four rounds to MIBR. ZETA's first round of the match came in round 5 of map two. It appeared as though MIBR looked just as good — if not better — on Sunset. Duelist srN, playing on Raze, spearheaded the MIBR attack. They'd end the map with a 512 ACS, the highest in a GCC match ever. MIBR Duelist srN could not put a foot wrong down against ZETA. Their 512 ACS on Sunset was the highest in a GCC match ever. They picked up 25 kills in just the first half of Sunset, and ended the two-map series with server-highs of 394 ACS and 43 kills. “We have a lot of things to show,” srN said after the match. “The other matches we are going to play? Be prepared.” Following a lower bracket run that saw them send two teams home after being sent down in the first round, ZETA Division GC is eliminated, finishing 5th-6th. The finish is the furthest that a Japanese team has made it in a GCC event. With the win, MIBR confirms a top-four finish at this year's GCC and awaits the winner of Xipto Esports GC and KRÜ BLAZE ."

Xipto remains in the tournament, and will next play against KRÜ BLAZE in the lower bracket . Despite both teams reaching the top four in GCC 2023 (with the Xipto core representing Team SMG at the time), this series is the first time the teams have met. As higher seeded teams, the teams only have one Berlin game under their belt, but still had expectations regarding the matchup. “I'm most excited to play against Alexy,” alexis commented on her opponents ahead of the matchup. On the Xipto side, enerii felt recovered after she fell ill upon her arrival at Berlin. “I feel good today. I think I'm at 100% today,” she said before the series. Xipto opted for a double-Duelist, Sentinel-less comp in their map pick . The South East Asian lineup took the pistol and anti-eco round, but Shopify caused enough damage to take the next three rounds. enerii 's Neon led her team to back-to-back retake wins with three separate triple kills, leading to a timeout from the opposing coach, effys . The defending champions recovered, but another 3K from enerii kept the score close, sending the map into halftime with a 6-6. The second pistol came down to the wire, a 1v1 between Kamiyu and meL that went Xipto's way. Their gun advantage was more than enough to take the anti-eco. florescent found a 4K, which led to a pause from Xipto. alexis and Noia held against Xipto's attempts the next two rounds, taking the lead for their team with a 9-8. Another two points for Shopify forced Xipto to request a timeout with coach Colbat , but it was not enough to stop florescent's Operator collateral or counter Noia's A stronghold, which helped end the map 13-8. Shopify's player advantage and Lockdown ends the map “They go in as a tight unit, it's what I expected,” SR coach effys said after Pearl. Xipto took the opening pistol round on Sunset . Their offense was able to confirm the anti-eco, but Shopify won the next three rounds to take the lead and force out Xipto's timeout. The pause helped the South East Asian squad equalize, only for Shopify to break the tie after a set play and anti-eco win. Xipto recovered, with a clutch from Tara setting them up to win the last four rounds of the half. sarahcat gets maximum value from Sova to secure the plant for their team Now on defense, Xipto won their fourth pistol round of the series. florescent helped deny the anti-eco, and Shopify continued taking rounds, equalizing at 8-8 and taking the lead a round later. Xipto closed the gap the following round after a shirazi clutch, setting off a back-and-forth in which both teams won one round each and took the following anti-eco. Shopify returned to B site for their final rounds, setting up a B main post-plant with their utility. Alexy did her best to deny Shopify the series, but their oppressive tactic and slight economic advantage was just enough to end the map 13-11 in the North American squad's favor and closing the series 2-0. The win sets Shopify up for a repeat of the 2023 upper final, in which Shopify Rebellion defeated G2 Gozen on their way to the trophy. The defending champions' core duo, alexis and meL, has now reached the top four at GCC for a third year in a row, having finished in fourth in 2022 and winning the 2023 version of the event. Similarly, Shopify Rebellion as an organization has been in the top three in all previous events, making the 2022 grand final with a different roster. Xipto Esports, on the other hand, will need to defeat KRÜ BLAZE in order to match their record as a core, having reached the top four in the Game Changers 2023 Championship as Team SMG."

MIBR, meanwhile, remain in the tournament, where they will play against ZETA DIVISION GC in the lower bracket. With MIBR making their international debut, the series is the first time both teams have played against each other. G2 Gozen has history with a different Brazilian team, however, as they have a 2-1 series record in their favor against Team Liquid Brazil . The loss came in the GCC 2023 lower final , where Gozen was eliminated from the tournament and left unable to defend their title. MIBR defeated Liquid twice on their qualifying run, taking Brazil's sole slot in this year's Championship. The match began on Bind , with G2 barely taking the opening pistol round. MIBR was able to win a couple of rounds thanks to their economic advantage from previous rounds, but a thrifty win from G2 led to a timeout from the Brazilian squad. This started a back-and-forth between the teams, as MIBR adapted with utility-heavy strongholds and G2 responded in kind with patient site takes. Petra gets an ace as she tries to keep her team in the game The first half ended 6-6, but MIBR kept their pace going into the second pistol, taking the lead for the first time in the series. Their success continued, as MIBR was able to string together a handful of rounds, forcing their opponent's second pause of the map. The timeout helped G2 get back on the scoreboard, capped off by a Petra ace. In the end, MIBR overwhelmed B site to win their last two rounds, ending their map 13-8. “We were having issues on defense, we were very passive,” Vania said after the match regarding G2's Bind. Moving on to Gozen's map pick, Split , the 2022 champions won their second opening round of the series with a solid retake on the A site. MIBR's continued aggression helped them take the bonus round, but G2 was able to stifle their pushes the next rounds. An amy spawn crunch preceded MIBR's first tactical pause of the map, but the Brazilian team's low funds and a triple kill from Petra continued extending G2's lead. It took heavy aggression from MIBR for them to return get back on board, led by srN 's Raze to an additional three round wins for an 8-4 half. amy anticipates MIBR's aggressive post-plant Despite losing the pistol round, MIBR was able to secure their eco round with a Classic deathball stack. They continued scoring rounds, thanks in part to individual heroics, but G2 remained in the lead throughout the half. In the end, Gozen was able to identify their opponent's weak A setup, and they were able to exploit MIBR's alternating retake and early ramp hold to seal their map 13-8. Sunset extended G2's lead in pistol wins, but the anti-eco was once again countered by an MIBR set play. Both teams won one round each, but early mid holds from Petra led to a timeout for their opponents. Her heroics continued, however, as she won a 1v2 clutch to further extend the score gap. Seemingly inspired by her teammate, Vania stepped up to bat, setting a retake up for success with a triple kill and winning the next in a clutch of her own. The duo closed out the last round of the half with 2 kills each on a B hold, sending the decider into halftime with a 10-2 score. Vania extends G2's lead with a 1v3 MIBR was able to win the second pistol of the decider map, taking the anti-eco with a Mel 3K, but G2 was set on ending the series in their favor. A methodical push gave the former champions their 11th round, and mimi took her team to match point with a 1v2 win. MIBR's second timeout came and went, as rezq 's Neon disrespected MIBR's B setup with the help of her team's utility, ending the map 13-4 and closing out the series 2-1. “We just continued playing our own game, the way we practiced,” Vania said after the series. “When [Petra] won that was the most exciting clutch,” she added. The victory marks G2 Gozen's return to a Game Changers Championship upper final, the first and only team to make the event's podium via the upper bracket three different times. They will next play against the winner of Shopify Rebellion vs Xipto Esports for a place in the grand final. MIBR GC will need to win two more series if they wish to continue Brazil's streak of top three finishes, first established by Team Liquid Brazil in 2022 and upheld in 2023 with Liquid's grand final appearance."

ZETA looked to have built confidence after their win over FlyQuest RED , with their defense proving tough to beat in this win over Falcons. Where ZETA had to prove their worth in the Championship tournament against FlyQuest RED, now the pressure was on Team Falcons Vega to rebound after getting swept into the lower bracket by Shopify Rebellion Gold , with no more second changes in the double-elimination format. The series began with ZETA choosing Ascent for map one, starting on the attack side. After winning the pistol round, ZETA struggled to get more round wins and entered the half down 8-4. Team Falcons Vega had that lead thanks to a 15-kill half from madv . ZETA's top performer from the first half was Moco , and their Spectre 4K on their defensive bonus round helped steamroll a perfect second half to win Ascent 13-8. SereNa was key to their defensive round wins, and worked alongside Moco to make their defense easy. Team Falcon Vega's pick of Haven was next, with the team needing to improve after a 13-4 map loss in their upper bracket series against Shopify. ZETA started quickly with another pistol round win, with suzu and Moco combining for a clean site retake on defense. Their Breach-focused retakes were proving tough for Falcons to manage, with aco landing key shots to help win rounds along with their utility. aco helps ZETA retake A site on Haven.

In their respective opening games, GiantX lost to MIBR GC while ALG went down to Team Falcons Vega , setting up today's game. For ALG, XiMiLu was subbing in place of 1hp due to health issues. Compared to GiantX's storied experience and considerable prior LAN experience, ALG had only played three maps in the China playoffs before making it to Berlin. Ness and Smurfette in particular were happ Haven was chosen by ALG and saw them open off with a pistol win. Once both teams got their full-buys, the map saw a consistent tug of war culminating in a 6-6 half. This trend continued in the second half with ALG taking a small lead at 10-9 but consecutive 3Ks from Miyori and ness saw GiantX gain the momentum to win the map 13-4. While only Yusin went positive on ALG's side, four of GiantX's players managed the same feat. GiantX's retakes were clean. Map two saw GiantX opt for one of their best maps and their experience on Ascent was clear to see, with a 11-1 first half. The combined efforts of Miyori and Joliinaa saw a six round win streak, and the only round that ALG won was thanks to XiMiLu taking down Miyori in a 1v1. The decision to let GiantX start on defense on Ascent was also a key factor in the map being so dominant for the European squad. That one round was all ALG would get and a 13-1 victory for GiantX saw ALG eliminated from the event. GiantX had found ten first kills across the map, compared to the four from ALG to boot. Smurfette pops off with a crucial 3K. For GiantX, both Joliinaa and Miyori had standout performances on both maps, with the former having a +20 kill differential on the Omen. While all of GiantX went positive in terms of K/D, the opposite was true for ALG. Overall, GiantX were able to consistently funnel their opponents into fights where they had advantages, and capitalized to find a win, especially on Ascent. GiantX will face off against KRÜ BLAZE next to keep their tournament hopes alive."

While ZETA had lost to KRÜ BLAZE , Flyquest had fallen to the Pacific first seed Xipto Esports GC . For Flyquest, L4ce was playing in place of sonder , as the latter was not feeling well. While Flyquest had fought hard against Xipto Esports, with map three heading into OT before their loss, ZETA was seeking redemption after a 2-0 loss, and suzu especially wanted to be sure they didn't leave Berlin without a single win. The series commenced on Haven, chosen by ZETA where Flyquest got off to a blistering 7-1 start. Evv and Starbound between them had 25 kills in the first half alone. ZETA recovered with three rounds to end the half 8-4 in Flyquest's favor, but with Flyquest winning the second pistol and the upcoming buy round, they locked in their victory 13-6. Flyquest's post-plants looked clean on map 1. Map two was Sunset, and while the first few rounds saw Flyquest lead 4-2, ZETA's suzu decided to take matters into her own hands and with her consistent paintshell kills, ZETA countered with five rounds of their own, and the half ended 7-5 in ZETA's favor. After the sideswap, suzu continued her rampage, finding 20 kills in just the second half — more than anyone else on Flyquest had in the whole game. ZETA took the win 13-10 to push the series to map 3. Suzu the killing machine.

Moco and suzu between them were able to dominate the first half, with the former finding two consecutive 3Ks in crucial rounds to ensure ZETA's dominance. Moco's two consecutive 3Ks paved the way for ZETA's win. Despite two more rounds being found by Flyquest in the half, the 9-3 scoreline saw ZETA division with a massive lead. Despite Flyquest trying to stay in the running with a pistol win, ZETA would not be denied, and closed it out 13-5 to eliminate Flyquest and find their first win in Berlin.

Karmine Corp's roster realignment began in September, when they parted ways with tomaszy , sh1n , and MAGNUM . sh1n has since joined DVM Esport , while the other two players remain on Karmine Corp's inactive roster. American import N4RRATE moved to Sentinels, clearing the way for the team to bring in another import. Saadhak joins a team that, for the better part of the 2024 season, had been on the outside looking in within the EMEA region. He holds a reputation as one of the world's best in-game leaders, and is looking to bring Karmine Corp towards its first international VCT trophy in the organization's history. The Argentinian was with LOUD since the organization's inaugural 2022 season, and had a successful time with them. With the Brazilian outfit, he lifted trophies at 2023 Americas League and Champions Istanbul , while also achieving several podium finishes. While he is most well-known for his play on more traditional IGL agents such as KAY/O, Cypher or Killjoy, he expanded his agent pool in 2024, picking up Neon following the duelist's mid-season buffs. Suygetsu arrives holding a vast amount of experience, having played for FunPlus Phoenix prior to the organization's relocation to the Chinese region. With FPX, he lifted Masters Copenhagen , and was then signed by Natus Vincere along with the rest of the team. Avez joins after two seasons with NASR Esports . While he was a duelist player for much of his career, he played different roles towards the end of his time with NASR, picking up Viper, Sova, and Fade among others. Elite joins after spending the last two seasons with Turkish organizations. He played for BBL Esports this past season, and Papara SuperMassive in 2023. He was BBL's Sentinel player, most often on Killjoy and Cypher. To begin the 2024 season, Karmine Corp lifted EMEA Kickoff , upsetting FNATIC before defeating Team Heretics in the grand final to claim the region's top seed at Masters Madrid . At Madrid, they opened with a win over FunPlus Phoenix , but went on to lose to eventual winners Sentinels and third-placed Paper Rex , being eliminated in the Swiss Stage. Following elimination at Masters Madrid, Karmine Corp failed to reach the international stage again in 2024, going home early in the playoffs of both EMEA Stage 1 and Stage 2 . At the end of the season, they were short of qualifying for Champions Seoul through championship points, falling three points behind FUT Esports . Still, 2024 was a more successful season for the France-based organization than 2023. They won just four matches in 2023, failing to qualify for any international events in the process. The team's roster was announced just moments before it took the stage at the KCX4: Forever Rivals showmatch event, where they take on KOI . Karmine Corp is now: Matias \" saadhak \" Delipetro Hazem \" Avez \" Khaled Efe \" Elite \" Teber Dmitry \" SUYGETSU \" Ilyushin Martin \" marteen \" Pátek Andrey \" ENGH \" Sholokhov (Head coach) Ahmed \" ZE1SH \" El Sheikh (Coach) Sergey \" fistie \" Vasilev (Coach)"

Shopify dominated the first half, snowballing a 1v3 pistol clutch from Noia into a 7-0 start. Clean shots from Noia secure her team their first round of the tournament. Falcons managed to break the opponent's momentum in round 8 off the back of a Sheriff thrifty, where madv clutched out a 1v1 versus meL .

After narrowly winning KRÜ's bonus G2 picked up five of the next six rounds before back-to-back KRÜ rounds forced a timeout from G2 coach Leader . Strong entrying from dods provided seemingly infinite space for KRÜ to work with as they edged out the lead 7-5 going into halftime. An excellent retake from KRÜ secured their second pistol to take a 9-5 lead. G2 managed to come back slightly by winning two straight gun grounds before KRÜ took a low buy win thanks to high impact from biazik 's Sova and dods' Bucky.

It was Xipto's core who, under Team SMG GC then, accidentally locked in four duelists and still ended up defeating the EG roster quite convincingly. The series commenced on Xipto‘s pick, Pearl, where both teams opted for a double duelist composition. Despite winning both pistols, Flyquest only found one more round on attack to be down 9-3. The second pistol round was all they found in the second half, with Xipto taking the win 13-4. Enerii doesn't need more than a classic. While dodonut fragged throughout the game, the rest of Flyquest looked quieter compared to the team-wide performance coming in from the Pacific representative, especially Tara who found several crucial multi-kills throughout the map. Map two, Sunset, saw both teams go neck and neck. Both teams won four buy rounds in a row to tie things up at 6-6. However, after round 14, Flyquest won seven rounds in a row to push the series to a map three with a 13-8 win. Two 4Ks from dodonut as well as an ACS of 378 helped them comfortably win it.

Xipto however had their opponent's number by then, getting to match point first twice and eventually winning 15-13 to advance in the upper bracket. Alexy and Kamiyu make a 3v5 round look easy. Xipto looked strong as a team, with both Alexy and Enerii having 200+ ACS and enerii consistently finding first kills.

Falcons will next play against Shopify Rebellion Gold , while ALG remains in the lower bracket in hopes of continuing their run. The expanded tournament means both teams are able to make their international debut, but they each have experienced players in the Game Changers circuit. Team Falcons feature the first GCC winner, Mary , one of eight players in 2024 to return to the premier GC tournament with a title under their name. Ambitious Legend, meanwhile, boasts the long-standing Thai duo of Muffyn and JinNy , who have been together since 2021 and represented South East Asia in the 2022 Game Changers Championship . Additionally, Yusin returns to the international stage, as she played for Chao Hui EDward Gaming in 2023. The series kicked off on Haven , Falcon were completely dominant throughout the first half. Their Neon-Iso spearhead was one of the key factors to their 8-4 opening, as the duo ended the attack with six first eliminations and 11 kills each. lexa and Toki 's map control was equally important, an oppressive style full of fakes and late rotations forcing out ALG's two timeouts by round 8. ALG was able to string together a pair of rounds after their second pause, but lexa and Toki continued their oppressive play on round 11, preventing the score gap from getting too close and helping their first half end 8-4. Toki net the first ace of the tournament in her international debut Muffyn gave her team hope coming into the second half, as her Jett led the charge to take the second round and anti-eco rounds. This set the score 8-6, the closest ALG got to equalizing, but Toki and madv turned things back in their favor in the bonus round. Toki won a 1v1 to take the next point, and Falcons did not drop a round afterwards. Together, the duo earned a combined 19 eliminations in the last seven rounds of the map, and finished the defense with a 1.81 and 2.37 rating, respectively. In the end, the pair helped Falcons steal ALG's map pick 13-6, putting them on a comfortable track to a series win. “I love the confidence, the excitement,” madv said regarding the Iso after the series. Falcons immediately showed why they had selected Split as their map for the series. They debuted a double-sentinel composition with Yoru as the duelist, catching ALG's more traditional Raze-Skye based composition off-guard. The sentinel-heavy lineup proved too much for the China representatives, as ALG was unable to take a single round in their offensive half, a dominant 12-0 paving the way to Falcons Vega's first international win. “Deadlock and Cypher are strong together on Split, I think the difference was Yoru,” madv commented on their new composition following the series. “This was my first game on Deadlock,” she added. Falcons Vega's shut down saw them end the first half with a combined 11-3 in first eliminations to first deaths, and, in terms of rating, the MENA squad's lowest-rated player matched their counterpart's highest-rated player. Toki's support-focused playstyle meant she ended the half with a 0.68 rating, but her 10 assists helped her teammates get a total of 53 eliminations in 12 rounds with a KAST averaging 98% and score ratings ranging from 1.58 to 1.98. Once again, Muffyn stepped up in an attempt to turn the tables, with two triple-kills giving her team two rounds and some breathing. madv had different plans, as she earned a round 3 Annihilation and found a 3K of her own to end the map 13-2. “I still feel like it's a dream,” madv said following their win. Looking forward to their next series, she added, “If we play the same as today, the same confidence, playing as a team, I think we can do anything.” The victory, beyond being Falcons Vega's international debut and first victory in the global stage, represents a similar milestone for the MENA region as a whole. While Mary had previously been a part of the inaugural GCC champions, Falcons Vega's participation and win also marks multiple firsts for a Middle Eastern team, as their previous best performance had been during T2 capstone events such as the VRL Finals in 2022 or Ascension earlier this year. Team Falcons Vega looks to continue their run against last year's Game Changers Champions, Shopify Rebellion. Ambitious Legend Gaming remains in the tournament, but will need to stay alive in the lower bracket, with their opponents still to be determined."

In an interesting turn of events, teams from the same region have been seeded on the same side of the bracket, which was avoided last year to ensure diverse matchups.

They have added Xavier \" flyuh \" Carlson , Dom \" soulcas \" Sulcas , and Dawid \" Filu \" Czarnecki in addition to returning members Bogdan \" sheydos \" Naumov and Grzegorz \" grubinho \" Ryczko . They have also confirmed Harry \" Gorilla \" Mepham , previously of Team Vitality , to be their head coach. KOI has struggled to be competitive in VCT EMEA. They have placed in the bottom two teams in both 2023 and 2024 regular seasons, and have yet to qualify to any playoff stages, much less an international tournament. Their lack of success has led to a player and personnel shakeup ahead of 2025. Having removing three of their players, including their in-game leader , as well as their coaching staff , sheydos and grubinho are the only familiar faces from 2024. KOI's new in-game leader, flyuh, comes not from EMEA, but North America. For the past two years, flyuh has played for Moist x Shopify in Challengers NA, leading them to be a top team in the league. However, in both years, they have fallen just short of reaching Ascension, placing third in each of the playoffs. Joining KOI, he will make his debut on the VCT tier one stage. soulcas is one of the most storied players in EMEA, being a founding member of Team Liquid . He accomplished a lot with Liquid, winning EMEA in 2023 and being a perennial international attendee. After his time with Liquid ended in 2023, he joined the tier two scene with Apeks in 2024. Along with a number of VCT veterans, soulcas helped redeem Apeks from their 2023 Ascension loss and earned the organization a spot in the EMEA league. However, along with kaajak , he would leave the team to explore options with other teams, landing him a spot on KOI. Filu has been toiling about in the EMEA tier two scene since 2020. Despite his history in the scene, he has never been able to break into the upper echelons of competition. Most recently, he was the duelist for the DSYRE team that dominated the Italian VCL. After easily qualifying to Ascension , they would go an even 2-2 in their group. Unfortunately, this would not be enough to make it out of their group. Filu will get his first shot at VCT with KOI. This new roster will make their debut at the KCX4: Forever Rivals tournament. KOI is now: Xavier \" flyuh \" Carlson Grzegorz \" grubinho \" Ryczko Bogdan \" sheydos \" Naumov Dawid \" Filu \" Czarnecki Dom \" soulcas \" Sulcas Kevin \" Noizeeh \" Jaskiewicz (Manager) Harry \" Gorilla \" Mepham (Head coach) Laike \" temoc \" Lewis (Assistant coach) Tyler \" Bambino \" Jay (Assistant coach)"

He played for the Indonesian team for three seasons, helping them stay towards the top of the Indonesian Challengers circuit and eventually reaching Champions 2022 . In 2023, BOOM Esports lifted the Indonesian Challengers League , earning entry into Pacific Ascension . At Ascension, they fell in the semifinals to eventual champions BLEED . After the 2023 season, blaZek1ng joined Global Esports, who was coming off of an eighth-place finish in the 2023 Pacific League . In 2024, Global Esports fielded another diverse roster, boasting players from five different home countries. Similarly to the prior year, the season ended in disappointment, as they would win just three matches across both splits and fail to qualify for the playoffs of any event they competed in. Towards the end of this past season with GE, he was the team's go-to Sentinel player, filling the Killjoy and Cypher roles, but had been known to play Viper, Omen, and Sova as well. blaZek1ng announced that he was an unrestricted free agent weeks into the offseason, but less than a month later has now retired.

Before joining Evil Geniuses, Apoth played for North American Challengers teams Renegades and VIRTUOSO , with those tenures coming before franchising. He made his professional Valorant debut in 2020. Apoth spent three seasons with the organization but was not a starter for his entire tenure. In 2022 with Apoth as a starter, Evil Geniuses competed in North America Challengers . In Stage 1, they were eliminated in the group stage, and in Stage 2 , they finished 5th-6th, failing to qualify for a single international event. In the 2022 season, Apoth played as EG's Controller player, not shying away from any agent but most often playing Omen or Viper. As VCT entered a new era of franchising in 2023 EG's roster swelled to, at one point, ten players. That season, the team achieved a third-place finish in the Americas League , qualifying to Masters Tokyo , where they finished second to European powerhouses FNATIC . Then, at Champions Los Angeles , they became the first North American team to lift an international trophy in Valorant's history. Shortly after Champions, EG released their entire reserve roster, which included Apoth. However, their paths would cross again soon when they signed him as their fifth player for the 2024 season. With a nearly new-look team taking to the stage after three of their starters were poached away, role changes were inevitable for EG and Apoth. He almost exclusively played the Sentinel role as Killjoy or Cypher, while occasionally playing Controller as part of a double Controller team composition. The 2024 season saw EG fail to qualify not just for any international events, but any playoffs within the Americas region, too.

With these signings, BBL has announced their full 2025 roster. BBL Esports has signed Elias \" Jamppi \" Olkkonen as their in-game leader for VCT EMEA 2025, pending Riot approval. As of October 25, they have also announced the signings of Dawid \" PROFEK \" Święć , Volkan \" sociablEE \" Yonal , and Egor \" chiwa \" Stepanyuk . Gregor \" PAL \" Morton has also been added as an assistant coach. \"I am so happy to get this opportunity and represent BBL for next year,\" Jamppi commented . \"To be part of this is an absolute honor.\" Jamppi hails from Team Liquid after having been with the team all the way since February 2021. His accomplishments with the team include a top-four finish at Champions 2021 , a top-eight placement at Champions 2022 , and a first-place triumph in the 2023 EMEA League . However, Liquid struggled in 2024 as it was the first year in the organization's history that they failed to qualify for an international event. PROFEK recently played with GoNext Esports in Challengers League East . Excluding the league's Promotion Cup, in which his team did not participate, the controller player distinguished himself with a best-in-league 1.28 rating and 1.47 K:D ratio over the course of Split 2. GoNext claimed first place in the split to qualify for EMEA Ascension , where they exited in the group stage with a 2-2 record. sociablEE has been a mainstay in the Turkish Valorant scene since 2021. He last competed with Fire Flux Vatangame in Challengers League Türkiye throughout 2024 as a flex. The team notably won Split 1 and later placed fifth in the Split 2 playoffs, missing out on Ascension. Individually, sociablEE ended Split 2 with a strong 1.17 rating and 1.20 K:D ratio. Much like PROFEK, chiwa spent the 2024 season as a top player in Challengers League East. He served as the sentinel for Acend and placed third with the team in Split 2 after falling 2-3 to Diamant Esports in the lower final, ultimately failing to qualify for Ascension. He recorded the third-highest rating in the league during the split at 1.14. PAL most recently served a brief stint as an assistant coach for Team Vitality throughout their run at Champions 2024 . Before that, he coached various Challengers teams in EMEA, including FOKUS , WYLDE , and Fire Flux Vatangame . BBL spent the 2024 season in a middling position in the standings, finishing seventh overall. In both stages, the Turkish squad came just one placement shy of qualification to the EMEA playoffs after a five-way 3-3 tiebreaker in Stage 1 and a three-way 4-6 tiebreaker in Stage 2 . Since then, BBL has parted with the entirety of their 2024 roster and picked up Burak \" LewN \" Alkan from Galatasaray Esports in Challengers League Türkiye . These arrivals to BBL mark the organization's first-ever signings of non-Turkish players and indicate a new international direction for the squad. This will also be Jamppi's first time serving in a formal in-game leader position. The new BBL roster will next compete in the EMEA LCQ of Red Bull Home Ground , which starts on Oct. 26. For VCT 2025, BBL Esports is: Elias \" Jamppi \" Olkkonen Burak \" LewN \" Alkan Dawid \" PROFEK \" Święć Volkan \" sociablEE \" Yonal Egor \" chiwa \" Stepanyuk Salih \" marqnue \" Onaran (Head coach) Gregor \" PAL \" Morton (Assistant coach)"

    "url": "https://www.vlr.gg/416833/a-retrospective-on-apeks-journey-through-ascension",
    "cleaned_content": "Apeks was one of just three teams worldwide that made it back to an Ascension finals in 2024 after losing in the finals the year prior. When they returned to try again, they earned a spot in VCT EMEA off the back of experienced talent and a star duelist, none of whom played for Apeks in that prior year's final. Heading into the 2024 season, Apeks lost their core of Enzo , keiko , and Mistic to Team Liquid, while ShadoW and MAGNUM joined other tier one rosters in EMEA. Even Itopata , their former coach, moved on to make big changes to their future VCT team. That left coaches DANNYTO and Desmo to head the rebuild of Apeks, aiming to continue competing for Ascension. “To win Ascension, you essentially have to be a good VCT team and an Ascension-winning team,” Desmo said. “Some of the best Ascension teams are VCT-quality, but only one team from each region makes it. We built this roster with the intent to compete in VCT, and I was confident with what we built. I feel like Apeks as a team is stronger than its parts, which is why we can compete with anyone.” Desmo was one of the two coaches who stuck around from 2023 to 2024, with roles ranging from analyst to assistant coach. He wasn't key to building the 2023 roster, as he was more of a pickup specifically for their Ascension tournament run in 2023. However, in 2024, he was crucial to their strategy and the building of Apeks. That included picking up former tier one players soulcas , hype , MOLSI , and AvovA . The team then rounded it out with their future tournament MVP kaajak , who joined Apeks after grinding through tier three in Poland. “We always knew about his potential, but the core question was: could he perform when it mattered?” Desmo said about kajaak. “He developed consistency from his routine to his performance in-game, and it boosted his confidence. Everyone on the team knew he could be an amazing player.” A team photo of Apeks in 2024. (Image via Apeks) Kaajak ended the Ascension EMEA 2024 tournament leading many stats , including a 274.2 ACS, 1.36 K/D, 175.1 ADR, and 0.25 FKPR. He led his team in match rating for every series aside from the grand finals against PCIFIC Esports . Even in a five-map series where kaajak was more understated in his performance, he stood up on the final map of Ascent and finished with a 21/12/6 Yoru masterclass. Moving from tier three to tier two looked to be easy for kaajak as he helped his team reach tier one in his first season, but it was tougher than it looked from a distance. A newfound focus on mental health, with assistance from the coaching staff, helped form kaajak from a potential star to the team's catalyst. “I was feeling pressure until I started working with my mental coach, and he helped me take the focus off of myself and more on the collective team,” kaajak said. “My expectations for myself are high, so I had to learn that even though I have a bad day, it wasn't only me playing the game. The first tournament, Superdome, was stressful, but I got better as the year went on.” Apeks finished in fourth place at Superdome 2023 , but only improved as 2024 began. While Split 1 was strong, Split 2 was a step up for kaajak statistically, heading into Ascension in form. It was a big change to go from playing online to on stage, and it showed in their first group stage match against GoNext Esports . While the team looked strong early on, they lost and learned some valuable lessons that helped them later down the line. “The thing we learned as a team was that we needed to manage our energy, no matter how long the series,” MOLSI said. “When we won our first map against GoNext, we were shouting like crazy, but we couldn't keep that energy for map two. We cannot waste everything emotionally on one map and then fall off later in the series. If you need that hype for an insane round that's fine, but we needed to save that energy.” MOLSI himself knew the importance of this moment, as a player who had played on tier one rosters like Team Vitality and OG LDN UTD . He wasn't too familiar with best-of-fives, but he had to take the reins while relying on some of the other experienced members of his team. “I don't think I played a ton of best-of-fives, but AvovA and soulcas have and it showed in those finals. AvovA especially was keeping the mood up and hyping us up. For me, it was a bit harder, because it was a fierce tournament where I had to put all of my focus into strong calling. Polaris was online, but on stage, that player experience led us to be calm.” With that tight 3-2 win over the young PCIFIC Espor, Apeks secured their spot in VCT EMEA for 2025. There were plenty of explanations for how they managed to reach back-to-back grand finals with entirely different rosters, but Desmo and MOLSI both knew exactly why this team made it so far: the family-like care they developed for each other. “Apeks is a team with good chemistry above all else, where everyone has a good sense of humor,” MOLSI said. “Personally, I wanted everyone to feel that we listened to them. At some point, as the IGL, I needed to use that IGL experience to make sure that everyone felt comfortable in their roles. We had everything we needed, from bootcamps to coaching, and we built to have that familial connection.”"

He previously spent time with Japanese VCL team NORTHEPTION and Korean VCL side TNL Esports . In 2024, Meteor was the longest-tenured player remaining on Gen.G's roster, having been on the roster since October of 2022. The season began with the team defeating Pacific powerhouses Paper Rex in the grand final of Pacific Kickoff . That qualified them to Masters Madrid , where they would fall short in the grand final to American team Sentinels . To open Pacific Stage 1, Gen.G went 3-3, qualifying for the playoffs as the top seed of Group Alpha. They followed that up with a run to the grand final, where they this time lost to Paper Rex. The top-three finish qualified them to Masters Shanghai, where they went on an undefeated run to lift win it all against Team Heretics in the grand final, earning the Pacific region its first-ever international trophy. They carried their form into Pacific Stage 2 , wrapping up the regular season with a 3-1 record to qualify for the playoffs. There, they defeated PRX once and fellow Korean team DRX twice en route to lifting their third trophy of the season. Champions Seoul was short-lived for the home team, as they would bow out in the group stages of the so-called 'Group of Death' at the hands of Sentinels. Before Gen.G's 2024 roster came to fruition, Meteor was the team's Duelist, frequenting Jett for the team. This past season, he was mostly on the Sentinel role, frequenting Killjoy and Cypher while still occasionally playing Jett or Yoru. T1's 2024 season ended in disappointment. They fell short of reaching Masters Madrid with a semifinal finish at Pacific Kickoff. Then, they showed signs of promise following a third-placed finish in Stage 1, which qualified them for Masters Shanghai.

After winning Champions in 2023 with Evil Geniuses , Demon1 and his teammate Ethan would leave the organization to join NRG for 2024. Along with three of the old OpTic Gaming members, expectations were set extremely high for the roster, with many proclaiming that it was a North American super-team. However, the year would not play out so favorably for them, as they fell far below what was expected of them. In Kickoff , they were eliminated in the semi-finals by Sentinels , and failed to qualify for Masters Madrid . In Stage 1 , they would miss playoffs with a 3-3 record, being blown out and embarrassed in their losses. Their lack of an experienced IGL was proving a major issue and one they would need to solve going into Stage 2. As a result, Demon1 was benched in order to make room for FiNESSE to take the reins of the roster and attempt to salvage NRG's year. Demon1 would remain on the bench for the rest of the season until he was released shortly after the transfer window opened. Similarly to NRG, Leviatán was also touted as somewhat of an international super-team, also having two world champions in aspas and C0M, as well as strong existing pieces from their previous roster. Also mirroring NRG, they would miss Masters Madrid when they too were eliminated by Sentinels in the group stage of Kickoff. However, unlike NRG, Leviatán were able to learn from their losses and become a top team in Americas. Across stages one and two , they only lost one regular season match to Cloud9 , and qualified to both Masters Shanghai and Champions . They also were crowned the stage two champions after they took down G2 Esports in the grand finals . Leviatán had a disappointing exit in the Swiss Stage of Shanghai, but would make a run at Champions to finish in third place. Despite ending the year with success, the roster would not stay together, with Mazino parting with the organization.

After their 2024 season came to an end, NRG released Chet and Victor, both of whom had been with the NRG/OpTic core since 2022.

ZesBeeW announced that he is looking to play Duelist, Controller, or the in-game leader roles, while also willing to relocate anywhere in the world. The Singaporean had been with BOOM since the Indonesian VCL's second split began. He previously played for a few Singaporean teams, including Team Ender , Bigetron Arctic , and Team SMG . Meow had been with BOOM since June of 2021, ending a stint of nearly three years with the Indonesian organization.

Meow said that he is: \"[An] unrestricted free agent, hoping to join a team long term as the Head Coach/Coach.\" BOOM's eventual ascension into VCT was yet another twist in BOOM's eventful 2024 season. The Indonesian side started the year losing in the grand final of the Indonesian Challengers League Split 1 to Alter Ego . They suffered just two losses in the campaign, with both coming to Alter Ego. In the Split 2 playoffs, they were sent into the lower bracket by Alter Ego. It appeared as though history may repeat itself, but they fought their way into the grand final and got revenge against them, winning 3-2 to claim Indonesia's lone Ascension slot.

Rossy, a former TSM and Turtle Troop player joins his second VCT organization since making the move to T1 last year. He joins after an up-and-down 2024 campaign with the Korean organization, which underwent a midseason roster realignment of its own. An early elimination at the hands of eventual runner-ups Paper Rex at Pacific Kickoff denied them the chance to appear at Masters Madrid. A 2-4 showing in the regular season of Pacific Stage 1 was enough to qualify for the playoffs, and a third-place finish in the playoffs qualified them for Masters Shanghai . Two straight losses to open the competition eliminated them in the Swiss Stage. With just four games to play in Stage 2, T1 went to the drawing board after two losses all but guaranteed they would miss out on playoffs.

M80 were dominant throughout the duration of North American challengers, coming out as champions of both splits. They were favorites to win Ascension , but their fellow North Americans at The Guard were the better team at São Paulo, and defeated M80 in the grand finals to take the Ascension slot. zander ran it back the next year with M80 for another shot at ascending, albeit with two new players, BcJ and nitr0 . M80 faced more challenge in North America than they had the previous year, struggling towards the end of Split 1, ending with only a top-four finish in the Mid Season Cup . It was around then when nitr0 left the roster to return to Counter-Strike, and previous Ascension winner neT took his place. With this change, M80 seemed to return to their former dominance, and swept through the playoffs to win Split 2. At Ascension , M80 were once again favorites, but the South American competition was much stronger than the previous year, and M80 were once again defeated in the grand finals at the hands of 2Game Esports . Having missed out on ascending twice in a row, M80 released their roster , allowing their players to pursue other endeavors. Throughout the 2024 season, zander was a standout player and became a hot commodity for partnership teams after M80's loss. 100 Thieves had an up and down season in 2024.

He made his debut in professional Valorant in 2020, following an Overwatch career that saw him win several titles. After participating in X10's Champions Berlin campaign in 2021, which saw them eliminated in the quarterfinals by eventual runners-up Gambit Esports , Patiphan returned to Overwatch for 2022. He came back to Valorant in 2023, joining Talon's active roster following LOCK IN//São Paulo. He competed in all nine league matches and two LCQ matches for the team, finishing with a 3-6 record. Patiphan flexed his versatility with Talon, frequently playing the Controller role towards the end of his tenure but also showing the ability to play as an effective Duelist or Initiator. After the 2023 season, Patiphan announced that he would take an indefinite break from competitive Valorant. b0i joined Talon as a coach ahead of the 2023 season.

He was also a stand-in for TSM Academy and Built By Gamers . Talon Esports' 2024 season seemed to be in constant evolution. After being eliminated in the group stages of Pacific Kickoff , they posted a 4-1 record in Stage 1 , a mark that was good enough to qualify them for playoffs from a strong Group Omega that had two other teams with one or fewer losses. After being knocked out in the first round by eventual champions Paper Rex , Talon changed their approach before Stage 2 . They parted ways with lenne , reducing their active roster to five members. They then went 2-2 in Stage 2, narrowly qualifying for playoffs as the sixth seed. They then signed young phenom primmie ahead of their knockout match, benching Surf . In his professional debut, primmie posted a server-leading 52 kills and 305 ACS. Talon would lose their next two matches, failing to reach the top three. Their knockout stage win over Team Secret , however, was enough for them to qualify for Champions Seoul through championship points.

Former reserve player Apoth , former 100T players NaturE and Derrek , and FaZe Clan 's supamen rounded out a crew of former tier one players to complete the EG rebuild. Evil Geniuses performed below the heights they reached in 2023 with their new-look roster. They failed to qualify for any international competitions in 2024, and finished Americas Stage 2 ranked ninth, a far cry from their third-place finish in the 2023 Americas League . In their first match of the new season, EG and jawgemo defeated G2 Esports 2-0. The match was the first domino to fall in a 3-2 start to the season that saw the rookie VCT organization miss out on Masters Madrid . As a result, G2 shuffled their roster, replacing one of the members from their Ascension-winning squad. Five months later, in a blockbuster move now looking to build on a roster that's become one of the region's strongest, G2 Esports upgrade a duelist position that has been shaky as of late.

BuZz has been a pinnacle of Korean Valorant for almost its entire existence. Joining Vision Strikers in 2021, he helped bring them to their first international event at Masters Berlin . They would prove themself as a prominent force internationally, being one of the few teams outside of North America and EMEA that could compete with the best. At Berlin, they would make it out of their group without dropping a map before they would fall to the eventual winners in Gambit Esports . In 2022, DRX acquired the Vision Strikers roster that would go on to become a mainstay in VCT. BuZz, along with MaKo , Zest , stax , and Rb , were untouchable in Korea. Apart from one series loss to Incheon On Sla2ers , DRX rarely even lost a map against their domestic competition. At international events, their legacy would become that of dominating the group stage and then falling in the top six of playoffs, as they did at Masters Reykjavík and Masters Copenhagen . It seemed they were doomed to repeat this fate in Champions , when they were facing another top six elimination against FNATIC . However, they would finally break through that barrier when they defeated Fnatic as well as FunPlus Phoenix in the following round . They would then be eliminated in a five map thriller against OpTic Gaming , but a third place finish was a new height for the organization.

Heading into the partnership leagues, DRX signed Foxy9 , hoping to have him join the active roster in place of Zest. However, they had trouble integrating him into their system, and would not start at LOCK//IN . Instead, the original five from 2022 would earn a top four finish and continue their reign as the best team from Pacific. Foxy9 would debut in the regional league , where he would help DRX earn an 8-1 record. In playoffs, however, their Pacific dominance would come to an end when they were defeated by Paper Rex . Foxy9 would make his international debut at Masters Tokyo , but when DRX lost to Evil Geniuses in the group stage, he was subbed out for Zest and would not play another game that year. With their roster troubles, DRX would fall in the first round of playoffs. In Champions , the original five members played their final tournament together, completing one last top six finish. In 2024, DRX released Rb and Zest, making Foxy9 and Flashback permanent additions of the starting roster. With this new roster however, DRX failed to qualify for Masters Madrid , their first time missing an international event since 2021. Shortly after their loss, Flashback had to temporarily step down from the roster, allowing BeYN to take his place. BeYN had been part of DRX Academy for some time, but was finally getting a shot on the main roster. His addition revitalized the team, as they went a flawless 5-0 in stage one , but fell just short of making it to Masters Shanghai . Stage two saw yet another change, as another of their long-standing members, this time the IGL stax, was released , and Flashback returned to the active roster. This new combination of players would take DRX back to the international stage at Champions , where they would once again finish in the top six. DRX's resurgence maintains their Champions streak, as well as making MaKo and BuZz two of very few players to attend every Champions event. Foxy9 found his first win at Champions this year (Photo by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games). With these roster changes, MaKo remains the lone original member of DRX. He along with Flashback will be the only two members returning from the 2024 roster. DRX is now: Cho \" Flashback \" Min-hyuk (조민혁) Kim \" MaKo \" Myeong-gwan (김명관) Pyeon \" termi \" Seon-ho (편선호) (Head coach) Kim \" glow \" Min-soo (김민수) (Coach) Kwon \" Argency \" Soon-woo (권순우) (Coach)"

Gen.G, who signed the three for only one year before the start of the season, have also stated that they are \"continuously in talks\" to re-sign them. Meteor, having been on Gen.G since late 2022, first joined in the beginning of the VCT partnership era alongside familiar names formerly from TNL Esports including Yeom \" eKo \" Wang-ryong (염왕룡) and Yu \" TS \" Tae-seok (유태석) . A tight first-round loss in VCT LOCK//IN against eventual finalists LOUD attracted attention to the Korean squad, but hope ultimately fell flat in the Regular Season by finishing fourth in Playoffs and third in the LCQ to miss out on both international events for the year. For the 2024 season, Gen.G decided to rebuild, releasing all players with the exception of Meteor. Bringing in a new core of hopefuls, all looking to one-up previous setbacks, the organization signed veterans Munchkin, Lakia, and t3xture – coming from T1 , Dplus Esports , and Global Esports respectively – alongside at-the-time unknown rookie Kim \" Karon \" Won-tae (김원태) . Munchkin and Lakia in particular ended 2023 as rough as their teammates, with Munchkin bowing out in the Champions group stage under T1, while Lakia saw a similar group stage elimination in Ascension with Dplus. The team entered Kickoff as an unknown quantity, but shocked the world by taking down both tournament favorites in the finals, defeating both DRX and Paper Rex to emerge as Pacific champions heading into Madrid . Gen.G set foot into Spain by tearing through their competition throughout their first Masters event, going undefeated until the grand finals with a narrow 2-3 loss to Sentinels . After qualifying as the second seed to Shanghai , Gen.G would make history for the region by being the first Asian team to win an international event. The lead-up to their victory involved a three-year drought that saw Western teams win every VCT title up until Masters Shanghai. In the process, the team made it through Masters flawlessly, going 6-0 in matches against top seeds such as FNATIC and 100 Thieves. With a third championship to their name in one year following a 3-1 grand final against DRX in Stage 2, Gen.G entered Champions as the overarching favorites to win the event as a whole. Pitted into a group of death against fellow Masters finalists Sentinels and Team Heretics, alongside Chinese dark horse FunPlus Phoenix, Gen.G's expectations were quickly subverted with a collapse against Heretics and Sentinels to knock the home team out 9th-12th. Kim \" t3xture \" Na-ra (김나라) 's contract also expires at the end of the 2024 season, however no announcement regarding his future on the organization has been made as of yet. Gen.G are now down to: Kim \" t3xture \" Na-ra (김나라) Kim \" Karon \" Won-tae (김원태) Kang \" solo \" Geun-chul (강근철) (Head coach) Kim \" HSK \" Hae-seong (김해성) (Staff)"

That 2023 season was full of ups and downs for EG. After being eliminated in the second round of LOCK IN // São Paulo , they finished sixth place in the regular season of the Americas League , clinching the final playoff spot. After defeating the regular season's third place NRG and second place Cloud9 , Evil Geniuses had done enough to qualify for the group stages of Masters Tokyo and Champions Los Angeles . A dominant showing out of the gates saw EG win four straight matches without dropping a single map, even clinching revenge over Americas League Champions LOUD in the process. A loss to Fnatic sent them down to the lower final, where they defeated Pacific Champions Paper Rex in five maps. In the rematch against Fnatic in the grand final, they would be swept 3-0. EG started their Champions Los Angeles campaign in a similar vein of form to their Masters run. They won four straight matches, only dropping one map, before losing in the upper final, this time to Paper Rex.

Entering the competitive scene back in 2021, BLEED managed to hold its own within APAC's Challengers, but was never able to break into an international event. Despite not being among the initial batch of orgs accepted into the partnership leagues, BLEED fought through Challengers and secured the Malaysia/Singapore ticket to Pacific Ascension 2023 . Fighting through the group stage and making it all the way to the grand finals, BLEED became the first APAC team to secure a spot in the VCT by sweeping SCARZ 3-0. The organization rode the momentum into 2024 and signed big names throughout the season, but managed to pick up only a single win against DetonatioN FocusMe throughout Kickoff , Stage 1 , and Stage 2 . BOOM on the other hand looked ready to mirror the achievements of 2023 BLEED in this year's Ascension . The team dominated the Indonesian Challengers scene and made their way all the way to the grand finals of Pacific Ascension 2024, but fell in a heartbreaking five-map thriller to Sin Prisa Gaming . Initially promised two years within the Pacific League, BLEED were slated for one more year of participation before being removed from the VCT. Riot has stated that their vacant slot will now be occupied by BOOM, while the Pacific League will continue with 12 teams this year.

The prodigy rose to fame after signing with TSM in 2021, a stint that netted him a Challengers 2 title and an appearance at the 2021 NA Challengers 3 Playoffs. However, bang's big break into the upper echelon of North America's scene materialized in the form of 100 Thieves, the very same team that he would qualify for an international LAN event with in 2022. Despite not finding much success at Champions Istanbul , bang would remain with the Thieves as they restructured to prepare for the partnership leagues. Over the course of the next two years, bang and his teammates struggled within the VCT, failing to qualify for Masters Tokyo or Los Angeles' Champions in 2023.

After his stint with FPX, he would join the Apeks team that went on to dominate tier two of EMEA in 2023, and were heavy favorites to ascend to the franchise league.

In the grand final, Sin Prisa Gaming dropped the first map of their Pacific Ascension campaign. Before dropping map three, they had won ten consecutive maps, though that run was stopped on Lotus. In the buildup to the grand final, Sin Prisa defeated FULL SENSE , who themselves had not dropped a map up until that point. The second map of that 2-0 sweep was a 13-0 victory. Boom Esports finish in the top four of Pacific Ascension for the second time in two years, having fallen in the semifinals last year to eventual champions BLEED . The Pacific Ascension trophy. (Photo by Riot Games) The Asian region's Ascension competition was held in a ten-team, double-elimination bracket, with results from last year's tournament deciding the seeding for the teams. The teams qualified for Ascension Pacific were: Revenant Esports FULL SENSE Rapid Lofi Disguised Sin Prisa Gaming RIDDLE ORDER Oblivion Force NAOS BOOM Esports Justice For Tomorrow Group Stage Results Upper Bracket The upper bracket of the ten-team tournament was dominated by two teams: Sin Prisa Gaming and FULL SENSE. Both teams, due to the format and seeding of the competition, were one of four teams that were required to play an extra match, while other teams received direct qualification into the quarterfinals. Both teams did not drop a map before meeting in the upper final. Sin Prisa Gaming defeated Revenant Esports, RIDDLE ORDER, and BOOM Esports, while FULL SENSE defeated Oblivion Force, Disguised, and Justice For Tomorrow. In the upper final, Sin Prisa claimed map one in dominant fashion, 13-6. While one may have expected them to carry their momentum into map two, the 13-0 blowout that ensued may have been hard to predict. The result came about on Haven, FULL SENSE's map pick that they had won on twice before in the competition. The win made for some eye-popping stat lines, including Ivy 's 411 ACS on Haven. Lower Bracket The lower bracket had very few surprises. The team that had just been sent down from the upper bracket won in most cases, with RIDDLE ORDER being an exception. After being eliminated in the upper quarterfinals by Sin Prisa, they defeated NAOS and Justice For Tomorrow to reach the lower semifinals. There, they fell to eventual runners-up BOOM Esports. In the lower final, BOOM was matched up against FULL SENSE. Both teams had been defeated by Sin Prisa 2-0 previously, and a high-stakes rematch was on the line in the grand finals for the winner. BOOM would end up losing Lotus, but Shiro had himself a clip on it. After going up 2-0 with relatively few problems, a 14-12 overtime loss put BOOM, playing in front of a home crowd in Jakarta, in trouble of a reverse sweep. Any worries of that were negated on Sunset though, as they came out with a 3-1 victory to secure a rematch with Sin Prisa with a VCT berth on the line. Grand Final A dominant showing on their opening pick and a good-enough performance on their opponents' map pick meant that Sin Prisa had a 2-0 lead heading into map three, with the chance to sweep yet another opponent in the tournament. It looked as though Boom had a path back into the match on Lotus. With a 9-6 lead, they had the chance to steal away Sin Prisa's second map pick, but a thrifty round seemed to change the tides for the Korean team. Sin Prisa claimed six straight rounds, but three straight from Boom forced overtime, where they won 14-12 to force a fourth map in the series. Map four, played on Haven, seemed to see the home favorites pushed with a new sense of motivation. They won three rounds to open the map, but Sin Prisa were back online following the run. Nine straight rounds from Sin Prisa gave them a comfortable halftime lead. The back-and-forth nature of the match continued, as BOOM tied up the map at 9-9 after beginning their attack side. They didn't look back, dropping just one round in the second half to force map five and bring the threat of a reverse sweep close to a reality. It felt as though Boom could do no wrong. They had the momentum and the crowd behind them on Bind, which they used to come out to an 11-6 lead. Despite the cushion of rounds, a Sin Prisa comeback forced overtime, and the Ascension grand final was settled 17-15 in favor of the Koreans. Francis was named the MVP of the competition. He finished the grand final with a 92/83/43 statline. Boom's Famouz had a 103/90/25 effort in the loss. Sin Prisa Gaming join VCT Pacific League, where they will be the the fourth Korean team, joining Gen.G , DRX , and T1 . Additionally, they will have membership in VCT for at least the 2025 season."

After a thrilling 2024 season full of highs and lows, one of the VCT OFF//SEASON's most anticipated events looks to finalize its representatives. The Red Bull Home Ground #5 NA Play-Ins are soon to commence, with a total of four teams meeting in Seattle, Washington in hopes of claiming a ticket to the main event. Sentinels , Cloud9 , and Moist x Shopify all received direct invitations to the event, whereas YFP were made to brawl their way through the NA Open Qualifier , taking down Ascension and Challengers representatives alike on their trudge to the top. Now, all four teams are on the verge of showcasing their talents with the help of stand-ins. At the time of writing, MxS have yet to announce their roster for the event, while Sentinels, Cloud9, and YFP have all been forced to utilize new troops . “I'm very happy and confident with the people I'm playing with.” stated Cloud9's Xeppaa when asked about his temporary teammates Mitch \" mitch \" Semago and Victor \" v1c \" Truong . “With mitch, it's always a good time… [Him and I] click really well.” After the disbandment of Oxygen Esports , the former in-game leader found himself temporarily reunited with Xeppaa under C9 once again. The recent rostermania following the conclusion of Champions Seoul shook up team after team across all tiers and regions, North America being no exception. Despite these inconveniences, Cloud9's veteran spoke highly of the two new pickups ahead of their match against MxS. “I'm also excited to play with v1c because I know what he brings. Playing with him for a bit and hearing from other people how he is as a teammate is exciting.” Another young talent who caught the eyes of many, v1c has made his way to Seattle to fight for the trophy, albeit not under MxS, the team he competed in Challengers under this past year. Xeppaa also spoke of another teammate from the past, Jake \" jakee \" Anderson , who would be attending the LAN under a different jersey. “It's exciting to maybe play him and it's great to see him make it all the way here.” After taking a break from competing, jakee found himself taking on competition in NA Challengers earlier this year, but failed to make Ascension. Since then, the ex-C9 Controller had to pave his own way to Seattle alongside the rest of his team, a feat that Xeppaa acknowledged, but not without concerns. “I know they're not playing with stellar, one of the biggest reasons why they made it here considering [he] was their igl, so we'll have to see [how they do].” On the other end of the bracket, one enthusiastic Zellsis didn't let the recent retirement of Tyson \" TenZ \" Ngo and Gustavo \" Sacy \" Rossi stifle his motivation for another trophy. “I think [TenZ] just wants to take a break and live life a little bit with his wife, Kyedae , everything like that. Maybe we'll see him [again].” “Sacy has been competing for at least 10 years in eSports, way back even before Valorant, in League. He told me in Korea… he missed home, so I guess he also wanted to live life with his wife. Everyone's got a wife and are happy these days, I don't know.” “We scrimmed with curry and Reduxx last week and I think they slotted in very well. I don't know the rest of the Oxygen guys that personally, but with Reduxx he has shown a great upside in his attitude, skill, and overall potential. He's been frying in scrims, asking us what he can improve on… for his age and with his attitude I can see him having a very promising career.” Both Xeppaa and Zellsis felt confident in their new teammates who – albeit temporarily – would be playing alongside them at Seattle. The two both expressed excitement at a possible matchup, a match which would only be possible if Cloud9 and Sentinels won their openers against MxS and YFP. Who will come out on top? (Photo: Shannon Cottrell/Riot Games) “I wanna see Zellsis in the finals… and that's about it. See Zellsis in the finals and… yell at him a little bit.” Xeppaa jokingly stated. “We both know that he ain't gonna be yelling at shit… He ain't gonna be saying nothing.” Zellsis fired back. With a single ticket to Berlin on the line, fans can expect the unexpected as the four North American representatives battle it out on Washington's stage. VLR will be providing coverage of Seattle's LAN in our event hub , where streams, pick'ems, and more are available to all."

After years of competing in the tier two scene, icy got his first shot to prove himself in tier one when he signed with G2 after Americas Kickoff . G2 were eliminated in the play-ins stage of this tournament, where they were defeated in an upset against MIBR . icy's addition to the team was met with mixed results, as G2 ended Stage 1 with an even 3-3 record. This would be enough to qualify them for playoffs, as they barely beat out Sentinels in a tiebreaker by only two rounds. They hit their stride in playoffs as icy became more comfortable in the team. They would defeat Cloud9 and KRÜ Esports , both of whom were 5-1 in groups, to qualify for Masters Shanghai . Going into Shanghai, G2 were commonly overlooked compared to the rest of the competition. Moving past the Swiss stage with a 2-0 record, they were chosen first by Paper Rex , a team many had hyped as tournament favorites, to be their opponents. G2 would make them regret this choice in a massive upset win over them. They continued on to defeat Team Heretics for a second time in the tournament, managing a comeback after being down 2-11 in the second map. This secured a top-three finish for G2, but they were swiftly defeated by the eventual winners in Gen.G and would lose their third matchup against Team Heretics in the lower finals. Finishing third, they were the highest-placing team from the Americas region. G2 proved that their run in Shanghai was no fluke, as they returned home to Americas and dominated. They cruised through groups and playoffs until they reached the grand finals where their momentum was halted in a defeat against LEVIATÁN . They carried plenty of momentum heading into Champions Seoul . While they came out of their group seeded first, they would fail to make it any deeper, as they were eliminated in the first round of playoffs without winning a map.

    "cleaned_content": "In the days following the team's loss in the grand final of Americas Ascension , murmurings of players departing the organization arose. It was finally announced by M80 that its entire Valorant roster would be free agents heading into the 2025 season. M80's roster before the announcement was: Marc-Andre \" NiSMO \" Tayar Gianfranco \" koalanoob \" Potestio Michael \" neT \" Bernet Brendan \" BcJ \" Jensen Alexander \" zander \" Dituri Vincent \" Happy \" Schopenhauer (Head coach) Luke \" GUNTER \" Clives (Coach) M80 on stage after the 2024 Americas Ascension lower finals. (Photo by Riot Games) The loss, a back-and-forth five-map affair, came to Brazilian organization 2Game Esports , who will be in VCT Americas for the 2025 season. It was M80's second time reaching the grand final of Americas Ascension. Last year, they fell to The Guard , who in 2024 as G2 Esports qualified for two international events. The announcement by M80 included images of all five players and two coaches from the team's 2024 roster. \"This roster has played a crucial role in M80's growth over the past year and we thank every single one of them for everything they have done for us,\" M80 said. \"We are so proud of all the hard work they put into this project and we can't wait to continue supporting them in their future endeavors as we know they will kill it.\" NiSMO , who had been with M80 for the past two years, was the first to announce his unrestricted free agency. “Grateful for the journey with the boys, I wish all of them the best,” he said. “Very grateful to have been a part of this squad & Organization! Now it's time to find a new home and I'm more motivated than ever. Willing to play Any Initiator/Sentinel/Flex Duelist I'm very flexible and open to IGL'ing as well as I have been co-IGL'ing for a while now.” “[I] can play any duelist and excel at OPing at a top-tier level,” said koalanoob , who fans may remember for his 2024 Ascension grand finals-leading 81-kill performance. ”[I] can play all smoke agents, Chamber/Sage and I'm willing to learn and flex any role needed to make the team succeed.” neT , who was on the opposite side of the 2023 grand final as a player on The Guard, was the third player to announce his unrestricted free agency. He said that he is “Looking to play sentinel/controller, I am very vocal, and I can co-IGL defense. Willing to relocate to any region.” M80 on stage after the 2023 Americas Ascension lower finals. (Photo by Riot Games/Bruno Alvares) In a post following this year's grand final, BcJ said, \"The feeling of not knowing what comes next for my career is eating me alive.\" \"It hurts so much that AGAIN I have to sit here and write a post about how my team (legit my second FAMILY) is getting split up due to the nature of franchising and limited player slots,\" he said, adding context to the reason for the team splitting up. Before joining M80, BcJ was on the XSET team that finished 5th-6th at Champions Istanbul and was not included in Riot's plans for a partnership format heading into the 2023 season. Current VCT stars johnqt and eeiu were on last year's M80 roster before being signed by their current teams. M80 will now have to start from ground zero. \"This season was one of the hardest seasons for me not only because of the loss but because of how much hard work went into this project and us being forced to split up,\" he said , suggesting that M80's roster breaking up was inevitable. He also dispelled any rumors of him retiring from competitive Valorant, emphasizing his talents as an initiator. “I wanna be the best player in the game and I'll do anything to achieve that goal,” koalanoob said in his announcement. “I loved playing with the most amazing teammates I could ask for and it sucks we are parting ways. But I know all of them will land on their feet they deserve it.” zander is still yet to make an announcement on his social platforms, but has reposted M80's announcement."

The sentinel player, who in 2024 expanded to play a number of initiator roles, was BBL's in-game leader this past year. This past season, BBL failed to qualify for the knockout rounds of any competitions they were in. A 3-3 start in EMEA Stage 1 saw them finish in a five-way tie on win-loss record in Group Alpha, but they finished fourth and missed out on playoffs. In EMEA Stage 2 , they went 1-3 and again narrowly missed out on playoffs, finishing with the same overall record as Karmine Corp but finishing behind them by two maps. BBL ended their 2024 season ranked 7th in Europe. pAura rejoined BBL at the end of the 2023 season after a successful season with Turkish team S2G Esports , which saw them fall short of reaching EMEA Ascension , being eliminated in the play-ins. Prior to S2G, he also played for Team Heretics , and Papara SuperMassive . In 2021 with Papara SuperMassive, he reached Masters Berlin , becoming the first team to represent Turkey on the international stage. In the group stage, they eliminated Paper Rex , but eventually fell to Acend in the group stages.

They defeated M80 in the grand finals to become the fourth Brazilian representative in VCT. A Cinderella story is complete. Six teams across the Americas region qualified to compete for Ascension. These teams consisted of the top two from each of the North American, Brazilian, and Latin American subregions. Competing for Americas Ascension were: M80 TSM RETA Esports All Knights Galorys 2Game Esports Group Stage Going into the tournament, the North American teams, and especially M80, were considered heavy favorites. In the previous year , the two representatives from NA cruised past the South American competition and met each other in the grand finals. Things would not be quite so easy for them this year. While M80 would finish the group stage with a flawless 5-0 record, they were not met without challenge, with numerous map losses and overtime conversions needed to win. The other five teams were all evenly matched, with no clear hierarchy emerging among them. The second NA team, TSM, would disappoint, as they were eliminated in last place, only managing one win. Argentina's All Knights would come second, finding three wins, only losing to M80 and their regional rivals in Reta. The other three teams would all end with a 2-3 record, although tiebreakers would place Reta at fifth, eliminating them from playoff contention. This left both Brazilian teams to qualify for playoffs, with their top seeded Galorys even bouncing back from a 0-3 start to the tournament. Playoffs Playoffs would start with a shocker, as the opening match saw Brazil's second seed 2Game Esports dominate the then undefeated M80 in 2-0 fashion. This game was followed by All Knights' win over Galorys, where in both maps, All Knights would find massive round streaks to win. This included winning ten rounds in a row to overcome a 4-12 deficit on Bind. 2Game would continue their momentum in the upper finals , where they defeated All Knights 2-1 to send them to the lower bracket to face M80, who had eliminated Galorys. The best-of-five lower finals started with All Knights domination, as they held M80 to a total of seven rounds across the first two maps. However, M80's zander would come alive in map three, putting up 31 kills to keep M80 alive. From there, the rest of M80 would wake up and roll over All Knights on the final two maps, successfully completing the reverse sweep, and earning a shot at redemption in the grand finals. The grand finals would also be a five map affair, but none of the maps were particularly close. 2Game would take Sunset and Haven, while M80 would win on Icebox and Abyss. However, 2Game's two map ban advantage meant that the final decider map would be Bind, a map M80 has only played one time in their history, that being against The Guard in the grand final of 2023's Ascension tournament. M80's inexperience showed, as 2Game would completely dismantle them, jumping out to a 10-2 score in the first half. M80 would find a couple rounds in the second half, but it wasn't long before 2Game secured their Ascension victory. This is now M80's second year in a row falling short in the grand finals of Ascension. Zap , put up a stellar performance in the grand finals, with a 1.34 rating across the series.

They did so by defeating Rare Atom 3-0. The third time was the charm for XLG, as Rare Atom was the team they lost to twice before, once in the group stage and once in the upper final. Both sides have players who are coming off of landmark performances in this tournament. In the lower final, XLG's Rarga had a 110-kill performance in the five-map series against Chosen Clique Gaming . In the upper semifinals, Rare Atom's UdoTan had a 39-kill, seven-death showing in a 2-0 sweep of Ambitious Legend Gaming . XLG lifts the trophy In the Chinese region, eight active and verified teams were selected for Ascension based on circuit points earned from Valorant China National Competition . Xi Lai finished at the top of the circuit point rankings, while Rare Atom finished fourth. The eight teams that qualified for Ascension China were: Xi Lai Gaming KeepBest Gaming Chosen Clique Gaming ZY Gaming Rare Atom Ambitious Legend Gaming Qing Jiu Club Xtreme Gaming Group Stage Results In the eight-team tournament, the teams were split into two groups of four in a double-elimination format. The eventual two finalists were both seeded into group A. Rare Atom made quick work of ZY Gaming , defeating them 2-0 and never looking quite uncomfortable. Meanwhile, Xi Lai Gaming defeated Xtreme Gaming in comeback fashion after dropping the first map. In the winner's match, Rare Atom defeated XLG 2-0 to claim the top seed out of the group. In the decider, XLG defeated ZY Gaming 2-1, keeping their hopes alive. Group B saw its strongest teams make quick work of the rest of the field. Chosen Clique Gaming defeated Ambitious Legend Gaming and then KeepBest Gaming both by scores of 2-0, dopping just 24 rounds in the process. In the decider match, KeepBest Gaming fell to ALG 2-1, rounding out the four playoff teams. Rare Atom Roll in the Playoffs, fall short in grand final for second straight year In the playoffs, Rare Atom continued their dominance, sweeping ALG and only dropping just three rounds in the process. XLG defeated CCG in a less-dominant sweep, setting up a rematch of the two qualified teams from Group A. After dropping a close map one, their first map loss of the tournament, and then easily taking map two, it took until overtime for Rare Atom to defeat XLG again, for the second time in the competition. XLG went on to play CCG again in the lower final, after they defeated ALG in the elimination match. The back-and-forth lower final went to a fifth map, but the final map was a 13-2 blowout going to XLG. It saw Rarga explode for 110 kills and achieve an ACS of 290. The 3-2 win set up for a third rematch in the grand final against Rare Atom. In the grand final, XLG came out ruthless, stealing away Rare Atom's first map pick and then winning their own map pick to go up 2-0, meaning a reverse sweep would be needed for their opponents. Despite their opponents having the double map ban, it appeared that XLG learned from the previous two meetings, and went on to win 3-0. Rare Atom has now made two consecutive Ascension China grand finals without victory. Rarga impressed in the grand final with a server-leading 57 kills, and was named the MVP of the competition. XLG will be the 12th team that participates in VCT China, and will hold membership for at least a year."

This was Apeks' second time in an Ascension grand final, but unlike in 2023, they walked away with a trophy along with the Ascension spot. A long time coming for Apeks. The road to Ascension saw the nine EMEA Challenger leagues each crown a champion after the second split. These were: Barça eSports (Spain) MOUZ (DACH) SAW (Portugal) Joblife (France) PCIFIC Esports (Turkey) Apeks (North) DSYRE (Italy) The Ultimates (MENA) GoNext Esports (East) The second place teams of each region qualified for the play-ins tournament, where the winner would make it as the tenth team to play in Ascension. CGN Esports from DACH would only drop one map on their way to qualify, rounding out the ten Ascension teams. Ascension group results Heading into the tournament, there were a few community favorites, with Apeks and DSYRE both winning out both splits' trophies. SAW and The Ultimates were also similar in terms of regional domination but in contrast, PCIFIC had one of the most interesting paths to Ascension, being one of the first teams to make it from Premier to the VCL circuit mid-year. MOUZ and CGN were the two teams to make it last year as well. The group stage saw Apeks dominate their group, only losing to GoNext in their opening game to finish with a 3-1 record as the first seed. CGN also had a 3-1 record, being the other team to qualify from group A. In group B, PCIFIC continued their win streak, not losing a single series and being the only team to qualify for playoffs with a 4-0 record. The second slot saw more chaos, as there was a dispute over a referee ruling during Joblife vs Mouz, where Joblife were not allowed to bring in a substitute despite the rules allowing it, which was ultimately a factor in their loss. The official ruling that came out amidst calls for a retake backed up the original call, leading to The Ultimates taking the final playoffs spot. Apeks dominate in playoffs The opening playoffs game saw Apeks convincingly defeat The Ultimates, while PCFIC faced their first tournament loss to CGN, dropping them to the lower bracket. Apeks would find another clean 2-0 win over CGN in the upper bracket finals to be the first grand finalist, echoing their 2023 journey. In the lower bracket, PCIFIC recovered and defeated The Ultimates to make it to the lower bracket final against CGN. The lower final and grand final took place in Berlin, and PCIFC found their first victory on LAN, taking down CGN with a dominant 3-0 victory to be the second team to make it to the finals. The grand final saw Apeks use their upper bracket advantage to good use, banning out Bind, one of their weaker maps, and Icebox. The first map, Sunset, despite being Apeks' pick, was a dominant map for PCIFIC who took it with a 13-6 scoreline. Apeks responded with a 13-8 win on Abyss with a strong attack side performance. Both teams won their opponent's map pick, with the Ascension spot hinging on map five's winner, Ascent.

Sacy was one of the biggest names in early Brazilian Valorant. As the Sova player for Team Vikings , he made a name for himself by winning Brazil's regional Masters 1 , as well as being the first representative of the country at the international stage with his appearance at Masters Reykjavík . While Vikings and Brazil as a whole struggled against the global competition that year, it would not be long before the tides would turn in their favor. In 2022, Sacy would join the Brazilian superteam put together by LOUD . Full of young rookies new to the top tier of competition, it was up to Sacy, the veteran presence on the team, to help mentor the youngsters and develop them into the world beaters that they would become. LOUD entered the international stage with a bang, where Sacy's return to Reykjavík saw him toppling juggernauts from EMEA and NA to make it to the winner's side of the grand finals. However, LOUD's inexperience showed when they were swept in the finals by OpTic Gaming . Their problems only seemed to grow worse when they were eliminated in the bottom two of Masters Copenhagen , once again at the hands of Optic. However, they returned at Champions with a vengeance. After making it out of groups, they would go on to dominate the playoffs bracket. Even Optic, their rivals throughout the year, could not stop them, as LOUD would defeat them 3-1 in the grand finals to claim the Champions trophy for Brazil. Sacy himself would put up a dominant performance in the grand finals, with a 1.31 rating across the series to cement his legacy as a Brazilian legend. A historic moment for Brazil. (Photo by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games) Sacy joined Sentinels alongside pANcada at the beginning of franchising, with the both of them opting to leave behind their Brazilian brothers at LOUD to join the North American organization. They would struggle to deliver on the high expectations set for Sentinels, as their season was plagued with a multitude of issues. Role adjustments, coaching staff changes, and roster swaps made it difficult for Sentinels to find their footing in the Americas league , as they failed to qualify for any international events. In the off season before 2024, Sentinels added a new IGL in johnqt , as well as replacing Pancada with Zellsis , leaving Sacy as the sole Brazilian representative for the North American organization. This new roster showed promise, winning their own Sentinels Invitational as well as the AfreecaTV Valorant League tournament. They followed this up by topping the Americas league at Kickoff to qualify to Masters Madrid , where they would take home their second international trophy, as well as making Sacy the only player to ever win both Champions and a masters event. Following their big win, they would face some turbulence in Stage 1, failing to qualify for the Americas playoffs, but quickly rebounded in Stage 2 and made it to Champions off the back of championship points. At Champions , they would pull off a shocking upset against the Shanghai winners of Gen.G to make it out of the proclaimed group of death, a feat few expected going into the tournament. They would find two more wins in playoffs against DRX and FNATIC to reach the top four, but losses at the hands of the grand finalists of EDward Gaming and Team Heretics would eliminate them at fourth place.

    "cleaned_content": "After over four years of competing in Valorant, three of which spent as the face of Sentinels , Tyson \" TenZ \" Ngo has announced his retirement. The talent stated that he will be remaining with the organization, albeit not as a player. This change for Sentinels comes after a recent fourth place finish at Champions Seoul , a notable finish to the organization's fruitful year in the VCT. Among the initial batch of Counter Strike pros to migrate to the Valorant scene back in 2020, TenZ kicked off his new career under Cloud9 's first Valorant roster. In the early stages of the game's development, TenZ was highly-regarded as one of the best Duelist players in the scene. His explosive playstyle allowed his team to make many deep runs in tournaments. However, TenZ would suddenly retire – for the first time – in early 2021 to pursue content creation, attributing the lack of offline events and unsatisfying tournament results under Cloud9 Blue. Nearly two months later, Sentinels found themselves in a pinch after star-player Jay \" sinatraa \" Won was temporarily suspended from competing by Riot, forcing the organization to frantically search for a replacement to assist them for Stage 1 of the 2021 VCT. TenZ was loaned from Cloud9 and returned to the scene just in time to push Sentinels towards the first international event of VCT history, Masters Reykjavik 2021 . The global stage was where TenZ captured the hearts of fans. He fit perfectly into the five-map unit and slotted right into the team Shahzeb \" ShahZaM \" Khan lead. Ready to showcase their talents to the world, Sentinels dominated Reykavik 2021 without dropping a map and began gaining supporters following their 3-0 over FNATIC in the grand finals . From there, TenZ and the rest of North America's best stepped foot on every global stage in the VCT that year. The first five to ever do it. (Photo: Riot Games/Colin Young-Wolff) Following a 2021 full of regional domination, Sentinels' dynasty began to show cracks. The next two years would see the North American powerhouse shuffle players around in hopes of making Masters and Champions. Unfortunately, after a 2022 full of lackluster results, the organization would rebuild the roster from scratch, bidding farewell to almost all the former players that once hoisted Reykjavik's trophy. The time prior to the commencement of the franchised system prompted countless teams to conduct roster overhauls, with only the best of the best remaining as star players. TenZ alone survived the rostermania and Sentinels entered 2023 with a brand-new squad in hopes of finding more success. Once again, however, the team was unable to replicate the highs they once achieved in the VCT and failed to pick up a single win internationally. Once again, the organization made internal changes to prepare for the following year, and once again, TenZ began preparing with his new teammates for the next season. After two years of beatdowns and upsetting placements, Sentinels finally qualified for their first international event of the season; Masters Madrid . The team upset many fan favorites within the Americas Kickoff to re-establish regional dominance and ignite the engine that would fuel their global run. While in Spain, Sentinels defeated powerhouse after powerhouse to advance all the way to the grand finals. Throughout it all, TenZ held his own against other household names, even after finding himself in a brand-new Controller role. A 3-1 victory over Paper Rex pitted North America's sole representative in a match against Gen.G in a bid for the title, which ended in TenZ hoisting his second Masters trophy in three years. Absolute cinema. (Photo: Riot Games/Colin Young-Wolff) Despite missing out on Masters Shanghai , the Championship Points accumulated by Sentinels throughout their Kickoff and Madrid runs qualified them to Champions as the fourth seed from the Americas League . A group of death left the team unfazed as they took down FunPlus Phoenix and Gen.G to qualify for Seoul's playoffs. In their last run of the year, Sentinels defeated DRX before falling to the lower bracket courtesy of EDward Gaming , the future champions. Poetically, the last match that TenZ would go on to win in his competitive career was against FNATIC, the very team that he once defeated to claim his first-ever trophy. Unfortunately for Sentinels, their run at Champs would end after Team Heretics shattered their dreams of advancing in a three-map match, closing the chapter on TenZ's competitive journey. Years of competing amassed TenZ a large following on social media as one of – if not the – most well-known Valorant players. The former pro now takes a rest from competing professionally and will continue creating content with a relaxed schedule.

With a new roster in 2023, Liquid started out slow, being dominated by Team Secret at LOCK//IN . However, they would steadily improve throughout the season, and would eventually come out as the champions of EMEA, upsetting FNATIC in the grand finals to hand them their only loss of the year at that point. This result would qualify themselves for Masters Tokyo and Champions , but their regional success would not transfer to the international stage. Across both tournaments, they only found one win , placing in the top six at Tokyo and in the bottom four at Champions. With another new roster in 2024, Liquid would once again show signs of early struggles, as they failed to make it out of the group stage at Kickoff . Unlike the previous year, however, their troubles continued throughout the year, as they would only find four wins through both stages of EMEA.

He had most recently played for the struggling MIBR roster in 2023, where he was benched towards the end of the season. While he was previously an almost exclusive duelist player, he showed his flexibility by stepping into the initiator role on KRÜ. His addition elevated the LATAM team to the top of Americas, winning his first five games to place first in group Alpha with a 5-1 record. This granted them a bye in playoffs, putting them only one win away from making it to Masters Shanghai . Despite this advantage, losses to the hands of G2 Esports and LEVIATÁN would eliminate them from contention. In Stage 2 , mta returned to the starting roster as KRÜ returned to playoffs, this time vying for a spot at Champions.

The organization had a disappointing 2023 season that saw them finish 7th in the 2023 Americas League and miss out on playoffs. That form would continue at the Americas Last Chance Qualifier , where they were eliminated in the lower bracket after posting a 1-2 record. With the same coaching staff from the year before and a mostly-retained roster, Sentinels would enjoy a better 2024 season. They retained their core roster, and signed former player Zellsis and added johnqt as their in-game leader. They finished as the Americas Kickoff champions, defeating El Clásico counterparts LOUD in five maps to qualify to Masters Madrid . At Madrid, the organization's first international tournament since the 2021 season, Sentinels dominated. A 5-1 record, which included a loss and eventual revenge victory over Gen.G in the grand final, helped write a storybook finish for the team. It was their first international trophy since Masters Reykjavik in 2021. However, a fourth-place finish in Group Alpha at Americas Stage 1 meant the Masters champions would not qualify for Masters Shanghai . Their shaky form continued through stage 2, but they would qualify for Champions Seoul through champions points, claiming the Americas region's fourth spot in the tournament. In the time between Stage 2 and Champions, Sentinels seemed to figure out what had gone wrong as of late.

Moist x Shopify was formed for the 2024 NA challengers season as a combination of the Shopify Rebellion Black and Moist Moguls rosters from the previous year. Shopify Rebellion had come off a rough season where they only just squeaked into playoffs and went out in the first round. Moist Moguls on the other hand, were only one game away from qualifying to Ascension, losing only to the two eventual grand finalists of Ascension. With a mix of players from both rosters, Moist x Shopify looked to be strong contenders for one of the NA Ascension slots. The season would start off strong for MxS with a perfect 5-0 record in the regular season of Stage 1, topping their group. However, in the Mid Season Cup , they were eliminated by Oxygen Esports to finish in the top four. After this loss, MxS struggled to maintain their form from Stage 1, ending with a troubled 3-3 record in Stage 2 . Despite this result, they still comfortably qualified for playoffs , and were still widely considered one of the favorites for an Ascension slot, with their main competition being M80 , DarkZero Esports , and Oxygen. MxS started playoffs strong with two 2-0 victories over FLUFFY AIMERS and Blinn to put them into the winner's final, only one win away from Ascension. This was the exact same position they were in the previous year, even meeting the same opponent in M80. As had happened last year, they were defeated by M80, putting them in the loser's final, where it seemed history was to repeat itself. However, with DarkZero and Oxygen being eliminated earlier in the bracket, they would play against TSM , a team they were favored against, having very comfortably beaten them a month prior. Unfortunately for MxS, in a shocking upset, TSM would overcome the odds and upset MxS, leaving them with heartbreak for the second year in a row. Although the current MxS players will be moving on from the team, Moist is likely to return in some capacity for the following year, as stated by Ludwig, a co-owner of the organization, on his stream."

Despite returning to the FunPlus Phoenix core that led to his Masters Copenhagen victory, ardiis and Natus Vincere have decided to part ways after a season of lackluster results, although he remains under contract with the organization. ardiis has been a prominent figure in Valorant esports since its inception. He initially joined G2 Esports in 2020, where he secured multiple victories in the European Valorant Ignition Series. After failing to qualify for multiple Masters events, ardiis parted ways with G2 and briefly joined Team Heretics . Following an early exit in open qualifiers with Team Heretics, he found a new home with FunPlus Phoenix, where he dominated the VCT in 2022. Although the team could not attend Masters Reykjavik despite winning Stage 1 , they achieved significant international success, lifting the Masters Copenhagen trophy and finishing fourth at Champions Istanbul . ardiis lifts an international trophy at Masters Copenhagen (Photo by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games). ardiis decided to venture overseas in 2023, joining NRG and one of North America's most successful cores. The team experienced moderate success, highlighted by a fourth-place finish at Masters Tokyo . Still, they ultimately failed to reach their heights of the previous year, especially after an early exit at Champions Los Angeles . In 2024, ardiis rejoined NAVI with hopes of rekindling their past success. However, the team failed to qualify for either Masters event after two single-elimination losses to Team Heretics—the first time any of the players had been eliminated so early since 2021. Their form deteriorated further in Stage 2 , managing only a single group stage win before being swiftly eliminated in the playoffs by Team Vitality . Despite the team's lack of success, ardiis will be a compelling option for teams looking to rebuild for 2025, given his strong individual performance and increased agent flexibility in 2024, though teams may need to pay a buyout to NAVI to acquire him.

Both of their Valorant careers started in 2020, but their paths would not cross until 2022 when they found themselves as teammates on FNATIC .

He still remains under contract as a restricted free agent with NAVI. Zyppan was one of the longest standing members of the NAVI core. Along with ANGE1 and Shao , he was one of the founding members of the original team when they debuted under the FunPlus Phoenix banner all the way back in 2020. Though they were always considered one of the strongest European squads at the time, they were never able to find any major tournament victories early on, falling short in the top four at First Strike and the EU regional Masters 1 in 2021. It was not until 2022, when the additions of ardiis and SUYGETSU launched them to the top as they earned the title of world champions at Masters Copenhagen . They would also place a respectable fourth place at Champions later that year. Zyppan becomes a world champion at Masters Copenhagen (Photo by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games). Under NAVI however, Zyppan and the rest of the team were unable to reach the same heights. For the whole 2023 season, they sat squarely in the shadow of their regional rivals in FNATIC , who were dominating the scene, both regionally and internationally. With cNed coming in to replace ardiis, the team struggled to find their footing against international competition, with their highest placement being a top four finish early on at LOCK//IN . Although they qualified for the other two tournaments of the year, they would fail to make it out of the group stage at either of them, a sure fall from the success they had achieved the previous year. In 2024, NAVI hopped to reignite an old flame, bringing back ardiis to re-form the roster that had won Masters Copenhagen. However, the team would drop even further down than they had the year prior. Two defeats at the hands of Team Heretics in Kickoff and Stage 1 knocked them out of contention for both Masters tournaments of the year. After these results, NAVI would make the decision to remove d00mbr0s (previously d00mbr0s) as head coach. The long-standing coach of the roster had been a pivotal part of their success, which became evident when in Stage 2 , they lost their first four matches, all without winning a single map. They would squeak their way into playoffs, but were eliminated at the hands of the Champions bound Team Vitality . Zyppan's removal from the active roster marks the end of one of the longest standing cores left in VCT. Zyppan has expressed willingness to move to any region and fill in any role necessary.

Oxygen entered into NA with its academy roster in 2022, featuring emerging talents like Reduxx and Verno, who would eventually join the main lineup. However, they did not participate in VCT. By the end of 2022, Oxygen replaced their academy team with a squad designed to compete in Challengers and ascend to the Americas League. Retaining Verno, they added seasoned players, ex-C9 pro mitch and controller-player skuba. The team easily qualified for Challengers and steadily improved over the season, bolstered by Reduxx's return after he reached the age threshold. Nevertheless, a loss to eventual Ascension winner, The Guard , ended their playoff run at fourth place. mitch, who attended Champions 2021 with C9, took up the reins of IGL for his new role on Oxygen (Photo by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games) Heading into 2024, Oxygen added Masters-winning sentinel dapr, forming the latest iteration of the roster. They dominated the offseason, winning multiple tournaments, including the Ludwig x Tarik Invitational 2 , and were favorites to reach Ascension . Early in the year, they lived up to expectations, achieving a 3-2 regular season record and winning the Mid-Season Cup . They continued their strong performance into the Split 2 Playoffs , but an early upset to M80 placed them in the lower bracket. Oxygen then rebounded by defeating top-seeded DarkZero Esports . However, a surprise loss to TSM in the lower round 3 ended their season in fourth place again. So far, the organization has not announced whether it plans to continue participating in NA Challengers in 2025 or is permanently exiting the scene. Despite missing out on Ascension, the former Oxygen squad, now free agents, will be compelling options for Partnership teams looking to rebuild for 2025, though Reduxx will turn 18 midway through next season. Head coach bonkar and assistant coach Rustun are other high-profile options, often praised for turning Oxygen into Ascension contender."

    "cleaned_content": "One year ago, EDward Gaming put China on the map by taking the region's first win on the international stage at Masters Tokyo and going on to place top six at Champions 2023 . Today, EDG triumphed over Team Heretics 3-2 in the grand final of Champions 2024 and conquered the Valorant Champions Tour in one of the greatest matches of all time. The five-map series played out on Haven, Sunset, Lotus, Bind, and Abyss. EDG leveraged their double map ban as the upper bracket finalists to remove Ascent and Icebox. Heretics won Haven 13-6, EDG won Sunset 13-4 and Lotus 13-9, Heretics won Bind 13-11, and EDG took Abyss 13-9. Both teams suffered disappointment in Masters Madrid and heartbreak in Masters Shanghai , but returned home and continued to build consistency and resilience. Both blazed fiery paths through Seoul, taking down every challenger to meet in the grand final for the first time since Shanghai. The ultimate prize. (Photo by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games) For EDG, to win would mean truly shattering the ceiling for China and taking the region's first international trophy after an undefeated playoffs run. For Heretics, winning would mean avenging the pain of falling short at Shanghai and proving the growth and potential of a team with four faces fresh out of Challengers. “I have always dreamt about this moment,” nobody said in the pre-match teaser . “This time, I will realize my dreams.” Heretics controlled Haven After their unusual Sage composition failed against Sentinels, Heretics shifted all five agents to mirror EDG's more standard Neon and double initiator on EDG's first map pick. EDG took the first of many pistols, but Heretics dominated the buy rounds with the steadfast trading and varied defensive setups that brought them to the final in the first place. Wo0t 's Breach utility shuts the door in EDG's faces. Heretics secured a resounding 9-3 half by consistently burning down the clock. They then chained a pistol of their own into an eventual 13-6 win. Both Neon players demonstrated impressive fragging performances; ZmjjKK picked up 22 kills to 15 deaths while MiniBoo found 17 kills to 12 deaths. However, it was RieNs who topped the scoreboard as Sova with a 1.52 rating, a 95% KAST, and an outsized 205 ADR. Sunset was pure EDG domination The players of EDG recovered immediately after dropping Haven. A surgical 4K from CHICHOO won the bonus round for EDG, snowballing into an overwhelming 11-1 half. Heretics were unable to find an answer to ZmjjKK's constant Neon slide entries and multikills, which included an ace in round 8. The duelist ended the first half with as many kills as all of Heretics combined at 18. Smoggy 's 1v2 in the second pistol round slammed the coffin shut for Heretics as EDG won Sunset 13-4. ZmjjKK crushed the opposition with a tremendous 1.87 rating, 22 kills to 9 deaths, 248 ADR, and seven first kills. Lotus was chaos, but EDG thrived in it While the previous maps had been one-sided, Lotus was a back-and-forth brawl. The first six rounds alone saw three thrifties and perhaps the most impressive ace of the tournament by CHICHOO in round 6. Neither team could shake off the other, resulting in a 6-6 first half. Whether on Cypher or Omen, CHICHOO always goes above and beyond. The defining moment came in round 20. S1Mon found himself in a 1v2 postplant against benjyfishy and MiniBoo. benjyfishy placed his Killjoy Lockdown to flush him out, but the Breach player stood his ground and sprayed down both seconds before detainment in a tournament-defining clutch. S1Mon makes the boldest play possible under pressure. Spurred on by their rookie's heroics, EDG ran away with Lotus to a 13-9 win. Still, it was CHICHOO once again putting up impossible numbers with a 1.71 rating, 339 ACS, and 27 kills to only 13 deaths. Heretics dug deep on Bind A do-or-die lead for EDG demanded even greater heights from Heretics. Both teams refused to yield for even a moment as every single round produced higher tempos, sharper frags, unlikelier thrifties, and yet another 6-6 first half. The breakaway moment for Heretics seemingly came in round 19, where MiniBoo won two crucial duels with the spike in hand to take Heretics to an 11-8 lead that turned into 12-8. But EDG refused to lose. The next three rounds consisted of magical plays from the Chinese squad: a tense 1v1 from S1mon, a Brimstone Incendiary body block from CHICHOO, and an Operator collateral from ZmjjKK. Just when it seemed that another ZmjjKK ace had secured overtime, Boo 's postmortem Incendiary burned down the time and stole away the map 13-11. ZmjjKK 's ace matters not with Boo 's Incendiary on the spike. EDG decided it all on Abyss An entire year of victories and defeats came down to Abyss, and it was EDG who took early control with a blend of unbreakable postplants, startling mid pushes, and both pistol rounds to take a 10-4 lead. Heretics attempted to mount a comeback, bringing the score back to 11-9, but ZmjjKK broke the hearts of Los Niños with four tournament-winning Guardian kills in round 21. EDG brought Abyss home 13-9 along with the entire championship. The round that ended it all. With this victory, EDG deliver Heretics yet another second place finish and make history as the first global champions from China after the region received official access to the game two years later than everyone else. ZmjjKK made his own piece of history by breaking the VCT best-of-five kill record of 105 with a generational 111 total kills, 26 of which were first kills, and was crowned the first ever official Champions MVP. S1mon also finds himself a world champion at his very first international event. To EDG, this victory means that China will never again be underestimated. “Why can't we get the championship? And now, the whole world [is going to] focus on VCT CN FPS,” ZmjjKK declared. They are your 2024 Valorant Champions. (Photo by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games)"

    "cleaned_content": "Team Heretics sealed their place in the grand finals of Champions 2024 , reaching their second international grand final of the year after a dominant 3-1 victory over LEVIATÁN . The best-of-five series was played out on Icebox, Sunset, Abyss, and Lotus. Icebox and Abyss were Leviátan's map picks, while Sunset and Lotus were Team Heretics' picks. Team Heretics won Icebox 13-7, Team Heretics won Sunset 15-13, Leviátan won Abyss 13-7, and Team Heretics won Lotus 13-3. The last time these two teams met was in the upper semifinals, which resulted in a 2-0 Leviátan victory. Both maps of that match were tight, separated by five total rounds, and this series proved to be a close one until the fateful fourth map. Icebox, Leviátan's go-to map pick in the last four matches, produced four overtime wins for the Americas Stage 2 champions. They went back to the well on Saturday, but could not find the success they had previously. Despite winning five rounds in their attack half, more than their three against EDward Gaming the day before, it was Leviátan's defending half that struggled against Team Heretics. Fueled by MiniBoo , who finished with a server-high 19 kills on the map, Team Heretics handed Leviátan their first loss on Icebox since the Americas Stage 2 upper finals. Team Heretics entered halftime after securing eight attacking rounds. It felt like they carried their momentum from the first map into Sunset, but as the teams switched sides, it was evident that the map had an attacking tilt in this match. Leviátan claimed eight of the next ten rounds, reaching map point, but Team Heretics won two to force overtime. In the second set of overtime rounds, Leviátan had little to no trouble getting onto a benjyfishy -defended A site, but with the spike planted, Team Heretics executed a five-man retake that dropped just one player and secured them a second map. A clean 5v5 retake from TH. MiniBoo again shined with 22 kills, seven of them being a map-high in first kills, while initiator player RieNs had a game-leading 25 kills. Leviátan heated up, and began hitting their shots in the second half of Sunset, but now needed an emphatic reverse-sweep for any chance at lifting the Champions trophy. Map three was Abyss, a map that both teams played the day before. Leviátan lost their three-map upper final on Abyss, while Team Heretics won their three-map lower semifinal on it. Leviátan ran into a brick wall on their attacking half against EDG, and it was more of the same against Team Heretics. They finished the half down 7-5, and needed a fiery start to their defense. Well-coordinated retakes, highlighted by the layers of utility from players like Mazino , arguably VCT's best Harbor player, made for strong retakes, giving Team Heretics a hard time holding site post-plant. Mazino even managed a defuse to tie up the map, a moment that Team Heretics' in-game leader Boo was milliseconds away from stopping. It's hard to mention Leviátan's success without touching on the flanks of C0M , one of two remaining former Champions winners, alongside teammate aspas . One of those trademark flanks helped his team secure the first of a four-round streak to take Abyss. A trademark C0M flank to help Leviátan secure a 3v3 retake. On Lotus, Team Heretics left Leviátan clawing for answers. On several occasions, an incorrect gamble stack stranded their opponents. Their attack half was dominant, resulting in an 11-1 halftime score. In the first half, Team Heretics had five rounds in which at least four players survived to the end. Leviátan clinched the must-win pistol and anti-eco rounds, but the bonus round was the true test of whether or not they could come back to win. The bonus round resulted in Team Heretics surviving four players and bringing themselves to match point, where they continued to dominate. Continued dominance from Team Heretics brought them past the finish line. Team Heretics' RieNs finished with a server-high 1.22 rating and 68 kills, continuing his potential rookie of the year campaign. Leviátan was top-fragged by tex , who finished with 57 kills. “We were all our own worst enemy today,” Leviátan head coach Itopata said. “We just shut down completely. I think today, out of all the days it could happen, was probably the worst possible time.” Five first-time champions will be crowned. aspas and C0M previously won Champions with LOUD and Evil Geniuses , respectively, but with the loss will end their campaign to become two-time champions. Leviátan finished their Champions campaign third and will end their 2024 VCT season having lifted the Americas Stage 2 trophy. After avenging themselves against Leviátan, Team Heretics will move to play EDward Gaming in the grand final. The two teams met in the playoffs of Masters Shanghai , which resulted in a 2-0 victory for the European team. Seoul will be Team Heretics' third grand final this year after Shanghai and EMEA Stage 1 . Sunday's best-of-five grand final will take place at INSPIRE Arena at 4 p.m. KST."

    "cleaned_content": "In the first elimination match in front of the INSPIRE Arena crowd in South Korea, Team Heretics beat Sentinels 2-1 to secure their spot in the lower finals at Champions 2024. This match was a rematch of an early game at Masters Madrid , where Sentinels helped eliminate Team Heretics early on. The North American team eventually won the first international tournament of the year, but Sentinels weren't able to defeat Team Heretics at the biggest event of the year. Sentinels picked Haven to start the series, leading Team Heretics to pick Icebox, which left Abyss as the potential third map. Heretics decided to gamble with their team composition on Haven, picking Sage and Killjoy alongside a solo Gekko initiator. Picking attack side first, Heretics lost their pistol round and frequently focused on planting B. Sentinels converted their bonus, hitting key shots early on to prevent the Heretics B post-plants from working out. Yet, when Heretics won their first round on C site down 4-0, they won five rounds in a row and ended the half only down 7-5. TenZ stepped up and got a 4K to win Sentinels their second pistol round on Haven. Despite not winning their bonus round, johnqt called a clean second half to finish the map 13-8 and start the series up 1-0. It was the star Omen from Sentinels that took over Haven, as TenZ ended the map with 29 kills, a 41% headshot percentage, and a 2.01 match rating. Icebox had no big composition differences between the two teams aside from Heretics keeping MiniBoo on his signature Neon. The map started with a benjyfishy flank and a pistol round win for Heretics, but TenZ wasn't letting an agent swap onto KAY/O slow him down. TenZ gets four crispy kills as KAY/O against Team Heretics. Sentinels played retakes well, with each player having their moments sniping Heretics down. However, as soon as Sentinels hit six round wins, Heretics adjusted their tempo and won some clutches to keep the map within reach. Sentinels led 7-5 at halftime, just as they did on Haven. Heretics won their second pistol round and secured their bonus to take their first lead in the series. Sentinels kept the rounds close, but Boo led Heretics to win Icebox 13-9, leaving Abyss as the decider for one of these team's Champions hopes. It all came down to Abyss, with Sentinels making their Champions debut on the map. Heretics won their pistol round, and Boo kept his form up from Icebox to secure his team the bonus round. Sentinels took a needed timeout to get their first round win on Abyss, but RieNs caught fire as Sova to prevent any first-half comebacks. Heretics entered the half up 8-4, in control of the map. Sentinels needed to win the final pistol of the series, and they did just that off of a zekken ace. There was a scent of a comeback in the air, but Heretics were quick to snuff it out off the back of RieNs. MiniBoo got a 4K to put Heretics up 11-6, and that round ended any chance of a comeback from Sentinels. Heretics defeated Sentinels 13-7 and won the series 2-1. With this win, Team Heretics will face LEVIATÁN in the Champions 2024 lower finals for a chance to make the grand finals against EDward Gaming . Sentinels, the fourth seed from Americas, finished the tournament in fourth place."

The three-map series was played out on Icebox, Lotus, and Abyss. Icebox was Leviátan's map pick and Lotus was EDG's map pick, leaving Abyss as the decider. Leviátan won Icebox 16-14, EDG won Lotus 13-4, and EDG won Abyss 13-11. EDward Gaming on stage before their upper final match vs. Leviátan (Photo by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games). Friday's match was Champions 2024's first in the 15,000-seat INSPIRE Arena, where the competition's top four teams will be decided. Leviátan picked Icebox, a map that had been a favorite of theirs, albeit a shaky one. They had picked it in their last three matches and won all three times, each result going to overtime. EDG began on attack. The South American side seemed poised to make this Icebox different. It started with a strong defense side, which saw them clinch nine rounds thanks to a series of great retakes, highlighted by Mazino 's Harbor. EDG's team comp consisted of four agents whose utility could be lethal in the post-plant, but they could not capitalize in those situations. They planted the bomb seven times in the half, winning just one of those rounds. Even after being blown out in the first half, EDG held their heads high. A pistol, anti-eco, and bonus round snowballed into them winning the first six rounds of the half. A pair of Leviátan timeouts did not deter them, as they tied up the score after facing what looked to be an insurmountable lead. After a quiet first half, ZmjjKK seemed to have heated up. He'd finish the map with a server-high 28 kills, but in the end, it wouldn't be enough. Seven of those kills were operator kills. With the teams knotted at nine rounds apiece, a moment of heroics saved Leviátan from losing a seventh straight round. aspas flicks, ZmjjKK heroics, and chaotic gunfights. Round 19 had everything. After the EDG run, both teams traded punches before heading to overtime. In the run-up to this match, Leviátan had three consecutive overtime Icebox victories against Team Vitality , G2 Esports , and Team Heretics . On this particular day, Icebox was defense-sided. Until the third set of overtime rounds, no attack-sided OT rounds were won. In round 30, Leviátan finally found the soft spot of EDG's defense, clinching a 16-14 victory. In the end, Leviátan's nine first-half victories gave them a cushion in a less-than-ideal attacking half, and eventually their fourth straight overtime victory on Icebox. On Lotus, EDG began on attack and looked to flip the script of map one, dominating on the attack-sided, three-site map. After bolting out to a 5-1 lead, EDG seemed to lose their grip on the map. They'd regain control of it, finishing the half with an 8-4 lead. The second half was more of the same for EDG. They'd win four straight rounds, with their 12th win being an exciting clutch for their star duelist. KangKang's 1v3 clutch kills Leviátan's momentum and brings EDG to map point. While ZmjKK is most well-known for his seemingly impossible operator shots and fearless playstyle, his Neon on Lotus highlighted his movement, sliding around the Leviátan players. He had six first kills on the map, matching the combined output of his opponents. His supporting cast on Lotus shone through. Smoggy , playing on Clove, finished with a server-high 19 kills. No EDG player finished with more deaths than kills, while tex was the only Leviátan player to finish the map positive, with a team-leading 17 kills. Lotus was Leviátan's first map loss after seven consecutive victories, with their last loss coming in the group stage to Trace Esports . With both sides split at one map each, Abyss would decide who earned their way to a grand final and who faced elimination in the lower bracket. It was still anybody's match by halftime, with both sides tied at 6-6. The question entering 2024 was whether or not EDG could replicate their regional dominance on the international stage. On Abyss, going into the second half, it was whether or not EDG's zero-sentinel team comp could defend against the Leviátan attack. On attack, the Americas region's no. 1 seed laid claim on mid, with aspas's Outlaw making space for his team to the defenders' side of the map. All the while, the story for EDG was their ability to lock down the A site of Abyss. Trailing 10-7, EDG called their final timeout. Their opponents still had two to burn, meaning they had their opportunities to stop any momentum EDG might find. Both teams eventually found themselves tied at 11 rounds each, with the star duelists of either side armed with operators. EDG reach match point against Leviátan, courtesy of three kills from ZmjKK. EDG wrapped up business the following round, only dropping one player and breaking past the barrier to reach the Chinese region's first-ever international grand final. Leviátan's two losses in their Champions 2024 campaign were to Chinese teams. Leviátan head coach Itopata said that there are similarities between Trace and EDG, but that there are also takeaways from Friday's loss. “They're trading better than us. They are playing more together than us,” he said following the match. “EDG individually is a lot, a lot better. If you give them something, they're gonna run away with the game. We should know now for the grand final to not do that.” ZmjKK finished with a server-high 61 kills across all maps, including a server-leading 20 first kills. Teammates CHICHOO and Smoggy finished with 59 and 58, respectively. Leviátan's Mazino finished with a team-high 57, while star duelist aspas ended with 53. With the loss, Leviátan will play the winner of Sentinels and Team Heretics in the best-of-five lower final. EDG now advance to the first international grand final in its region's history and await the victor of that lower final. The lower final will take place on Saturday at 4 p.m. KST, and the grand final will be on Sunday at the same time."

    "url": "https://www.vlr.gg/381456/vlr-rating-2-0-update",
    "cleaned_content": "The VLR rating has received an update, and here is what you need to know. As we approach the close of two years of VCT competition since the original rating was released, a modernization is in order. The game has changed significantly over the past two years, and the rating has been exposed to far more eyes across far more games than it could have been in development. The core mechanics of the rating described in this explainer article , are still in place. However, it was determined that the rating skewed somewhat too heavily towards passivity relative to aggression. While it is important to capture the impact of supportive players that isn't reflected in their pure kill and death numbers, this update focuses around a small rebalancing of the scales against passive play. The original rating was a combination of five factors: a kill contribution, death contribution, assist contribution, damage contribution, and survival contribution. The kill and death contributions were by far the most impactful, and they incorporated information about things like economic advantages, trading, and weighting the player differential for each fight. Previously the fight weighting was based on the number of players alive on each team when a fight took place. For example, a kill in a 5v5 is worth more than a kill in a 5v2. However, turning a 4v5 into a 4v4 was worth less than the maximum weight because the player differential when the fight took place was greater than zero. It can be argued that turning a one player disadvantage into an equal situation has an equivalent impact to turning an equal situation into a one player advantage on average. Rating 2.0 makes that the case. Even though the trading logic in the original rating was modified to not count against a player if it led to team success, and top duelists still had strong average ratings compared to many other agents, aggressive players were still frequently hampered by the trading modifier. In Rating 2.0, the effect of trading on a fight has been reduced. The original rating was balanced on numbers from mid-2021 to mid-2022, but Valorant has balance changes which can significantly affect the rating. Right after the public release of the rating, patch 5.12 threw a spanner in the works with assist tails . Essentially, KAY/0, the controllers, and certain initiators suddenly saw a massive uptick in their assist totals. KAY/0 getting assists up to three seconds after his eight second suppression has expired or controllers getting assists two seconds after someone simply touched their smoke blew up a bunch of ratings in ways that didn't reflect their actual value. The overall weight of assists in Rating 2.0 has been reduced. The survival contribution was intended to be a metric that rewarded players for saving valuable guns into the next round. This entire component was removed from the rating to focus it on the value a player provides within each round. The original weighting of this contribution was small, so removing it has a fairly minimal effect, but it is another minor chip in the armor of passive play. The composite rating is roughly a bell curve, and it can be scaled to whatever mean and standard deviation is convenient. Although future balance changes will likely shift the distribution of ratings slightly, Rating 2.0 is set to have an average rating of 1.0 and a standard deviation of ⅓. There are some fringe cases, where certain ratings shift dramatically, (see this game from kaajak where he originally had a 1.03 rating but now has a 1.20), but overall, the majority of ratings will not change by more than a couple percentage points."

This change comes soon after releasing their coaching staff and announcing open tryouts for their 2025 roster. Following an unsuccessful 2023 season, Global Esports made a complete overhaul of their roster, with not a single player from the starting five making a return for 2024. Their new roster consisted of a crop of underdog players from all around the world. The rebuild started with promoting their longstanding member and previous sixth man, Abhirup \" Lightningfast \" Choudhury , as well as acquiring Benedict \" Benkai \" Tan from the bench of Paper Rex in exchange for the Indonesian superstar Monyet . Former Guild player Russel \" Russ \" Mendes would then be added as the team's in-game leader, who had come off the back of a year of playing in the European VCLs. Similarly, Niko \" Polvi \" Polvinen would come from the depths of EMEA challengers to join the roster, along with Gary \" blaZek1ng \" Dastin from the Pacific Ascension semi-finalists of BOOM Esports . Going into the 2024 season, Global Esports was not very highly rated in comparison to their competition in Pacific. They looked to defy these expectations early on with a win against the Ascension winning BLEED during Kickoff , but two losses at the hands of ZETA DIVISION put Masters Madrid out of their sights. Stage 1 was a similar story, with their 2-3 record being insufficient to qualify them to playoffs. With their poor performance in Stage 1, they would've needed a miraculous Stage 2 for the team to come anywhere close to qualifying to playoffs, let alone Champions. They would only pick up one more win for the rest of the season, ending with a record of 3-7, and placing ninth in the league. Global Esports after their win against Bleed during Kickoff Global Esports is looking towards a complete overhaul of the entire team going into 2025. A new coaching staff as well as a roster found through open tryouts will bring a completely fresh look for the Indian organization. Their current player roster will also be put through the team's tryouts, with a chance to return to the active roster in 2025, but have been allowed to explore other options during the off season.

    "cleaned_content": "Team Heretics have eliminated DRX following a 2-1 win . They are now in the top four at their first-ever Champions appearance, and will next play against Sentinels following their win against FNATIC . DRX, meanwhile, are now eliminated from the event, ending in the top six in the first international tournament in South Korea. This matchup is the first time both teams have played against each other, as DRX had been unable to qualify to either Masters event earlier in the year. Both teams went through roster turmoil during 2024, as DRX saw the need to go through a rebuild and Team Heretics were forced to play with star-substitute paTiTek due to scheduling and visa conflicts . Now at their full potential, the teams were pit against each other in an elimination series at the most important VCT stage of the year. The map veto erred slightly in Team Heretics' favor , as they had more clarity on which maps they preferred and which they could leave out. Ahead of the series, the decider map, Icebox, could be considered a strong end for DRX , but most of their victories had been against weaker regional teams. The map was not uncomfortable for Heretics, however, as they tended to leave it open, only banning it first once since the beginning of Stage 2. The European team's more decisive selection process also left Abyss as the first map, on which Heretics were only slightly less successful than DRX. DRX kicked off the series by denying a retake on their Abyss B plant. A slow, two-pronged approach gave them the anti-eco, and Heretics were able to win the bonus with a quick plant denial. Flashback and BuZz were next to show up, granting the hometown team a pair of rounds to go up with a 4-1 lead. Three ultimates and a MiniBoo 3K helped Heretics close the gap, setting the score at 4-3. A back-and-forth ending at 5-5 led to both teams' respective timeouts, the second of which helped DRX close out the half 7-5. DRX recover from a 3v5 with well placed defensive utility Now on the defense, DRX extended their two-round streak, taking their second pistol and winning the anti-eco with ease. Despite a Boo lurking double-kill, DRX recovered the bonus round by using defensive utility to force mistakes from Heretics. A Heretics timeout was unfruitful, as Flashback showed up in early rounds and DRX's player advantage helped deny Boo's Astra post-plants. The map ended unceremoniously, with BeYN and MaKo finishing off a 2v2 and closing out Abyss 13-5. “We had our eye on Abyss since it first came out,” DRX coach termi said after map one. “We thought we could take on Heretics with that map pick.” His counterpart, Heretics coach neilzinho , was more optimistic on the second map. “That was shambolic,” neil said regarding their Abyss performance. “[Sunset] is always a map we're comfortable on,” he added. “We've been looking to play against certain teams; DRX is one of them.” Team Heretics changed their composition from Neon to Raze, keen for redemption on Sunset . They proved as much on defense, taking their first pistol of the half and bringing the bonus round down to the wire. Four more rounds followed for the European squad, as they consistently suffocated DRX's offensive attempts. DRX were able to recover, however, as they took an eco round and were able to use their set executes to break open the B site. With BuZz in the lead, DRX closed out the half 7-5. Heretics use their opponent's timeout to adapt and play a more straightforward round A slow pistol round helped set Heretics up for an anti-retake plant, putting control back into the Masters finalists' hands. Team Heretics continued playing with both wings of the map, using timings and well-placed utility to mask their intentions. A pause was called for by DRX after 11-5, giving the team a window to plan and reset for the rest of the half. Two fast rounds followed from Heretics, the adaptation confusing the defense and ending map two 13-5, tying the score at 1-1. Heading into Icebox, benjyfishy helped win a third pistol round for his team. Their defense started off successfully, taking an early 3-1 lead. Round five began in similar fashion, early kills leaving two DRX members stranded in mid. The round was not over, however, and Heretics began peeking into MaKo, who eliminated the defenders one by one until he ended up in a 1v1. The extra eliminations gave him a Viper's Pit, and MaKo closed out the ace. Two more rounds went DRX's way, planting on a weaker A site and giving them the lead. A Heretics timeout reinforced their problem site, but DRX poked and prodded the defense, brute-forcing their way to a sixth round win. The South Korean squad continued insisting on the site, eventually dropping a thrifty round. A Sova-Killjoy post-plant gave them the next round, and Wo0t clawed back a B retake to end the half 7-5 in DRX's favor. Wo0t saves his team from disaster The hometown team extended their lead in the second half after a stuck defuse from Flashback. Heretics stabilized after winning the bonus round, taking an additional pair of rounds without much resistance. The 9-8 scoreline led to a DRX pause, enabling Flashback and Foxy9 to take a point. Heretics continued with their A plan, which ended in success and weakened the defense's economy. The plant switched sites against the low buy, but returned to A to find success and take the lead 11-10. The European squad's continued offensive success had left them with an ultimate and economic advantage that was impossible to overcome. Despite repeat incursions into a fully-reinforced A site, they eventually left DRX with no economy or ultimates compared to Heretics' three ults. The Champions débutants took the anti-eco by using a Lockdown to plant and a Viper's Pit for their post-plant. RieNs opened their match point with his own ultimate, eliminating BuZz and leaving two more at half health. Team Heretics rushed to rotate, ending Icebox 13-10 and moving forward with a 2-1 victory. Heretics' attack eventually left DRX with an insurmountable ultimate and credit deficit. “We can play well, everybody knows that,” Boo said after their win. “I'm actually really happy to play Sentinels,” he added. His brother and Heretics spearhead, MiniBoo, was emotional following the series. “After the first game I just thought, ‘I don't want to sit another six months without doing anything and regret this day',” he said. “I did everything I could to benefit our odds to win this game,” he added. Team Heretics will now play against Sentinels in the lower semifinal , a rematch of the European team's international debut . Both teams were Masters finalists this year, but Sentinels were the only one of the pair to win an event . DRX are now eliminated on home soil, their rebuilt roster matching the team's previous Champions finish ."

    "cleaned_content": "In a matchup between two teams with a rivalry spanning over three years, Sentinels defeated FNATIC 2-1, eliminating them from Champions 2024 . The three-map series was played out on Sunset, Bind, and Lotus. Sunset was Sentinels's pick, Bind was Fnatic's, and Lotus was the decider. Sentinels won Sunset 13-11, Fnatic won Bind 13-9, and Sentinels won Lotus 13-6. Sunday's elimination match was the fourth-ever meeting between the two international powerhouses. Sentinels defeated Fnatic twice, 2-0 and 3-0, en route to capturing their first international trophy at Masters Reykjavik . They'd meet again two seasons later in the first round of LOCK//IN São Paulo , where Fnatic would claim a 2-0 revenge victory. On Sunset, EMEA's number-one seed got off to a flying start. They won the first three rounds of their attacking half, giving up just three kills to Sentinels in the process. They played solid team Valorant, with every peek having an accompanied teammate and every post-plant having layered utility to give them the space needed for the spike to detonate. Facing an 8-4 deficit at halftime, Sentinels regrouped and came back swinging. They won four of their first five attack rounds, seeming to have a read on Fnatic's defensive protocols. In-game leader [johnqt] had a great read on what Fnatic wanted to do, and when it seemed as though the European team could claw their way back in, Sentinels put a stamp on the map, sealing a 13-11 finish that may have been too close for comfort. SEN's star TenZ snags a crucial 4K to seal the first map. It wasn't just the in-game commanding that johnqt was great at – he was also a great shot on Sunset. He finished with the most kills in the server with a 23-12 scoreline. Fnatic had 15 first kills on the map, but couldn't make the most of their man-advantage scenarios. Sentinels began Bind on the attack and quickly identified the gaps in Fnatic's defense. Unfortunately for them, Fnatic was also adept in their attack half. They'd only give up two rounds en route to a clean 13-9 victory, with their eleventh-round clinching execution leaving Sentinels' economy limped for the rest of the map. Fnatic executes onto B site, forcing Sentinels' last two players to save. In Round 20, holding onto a 10-9 lead with Sentinels threatening to tie the game at 10 apiece, Fnatic executed a near-perfect take onto the B site. Across both Sunset and Bind, both teams made great use of ultimate abilities to seal rounds. Fnatic closed the map 13-9, bringing both teams to Lotus. Sentinels' most recent outing on the map was from their 2-1 loss to EDward Gaming the day before. Sentinels played a relatively clean attacking half to open Lotus, a map widely regarded as attack-sided. Poking and prodding at the Fnatic defense gave Sentinels easy access to either of the three bomb sites, leading to an 8-4 lead. Two of the four round wins came as a result of them running out of time, unable to get the spike planted. Fnatic's Boaster described the defensive half of Lotus as frustrating. “It could've gone either way, but that's just Valorant. It's a frustrating game to be a part of and it can happen,” he said. Similar to Sunset, Fnatic had nine first kills, but could not convert on those man-advantages. “The scoreline says one thing, but our defense should have been reversed in terms of how many rounds they got and how many rounds we got.” In the second half though, Sentinels showed their success in this series wouldn't be exclusive to the attacking half. They'd win the pistol, anti-eco and bonus rounds to reach 11 rounds, just two away from advancing and eliminating Fnatic. Facing an 11-4 deficit, Fnatic had a must-win round on their hands. They managed to plant the spike but with one man falling earlier in the round, a Sentinels retake was made too easy. With a 5-4 man advantage, Sentinels make their B site retake look easy. Fnatic mounted a comeback attempt the following round, clinching two rounds thanks to some time-savvy decision-making from Boaster. Fnatic closed out the following round, bubbling up some momentum, but it was never going to be enough against the economy-backed confidence of Sentinels, leaving them in the dust with a 13-6 scoreline. Derke finished 61-47, having the most kills in the server, while johnqt led his team in kills with a 55-37 scoreline. “It is what it is. I'm not gonna beat myself up about it. I've already had a pretty dog event,” Boaster said with a chuckle following the match. He appeared to be in good spirits, even answering a question from Sentinels' Zellsis , who has been plying his trade as a reporter as of late. With the victory, Sentinels punch their ticket to INSPIRE Arena and will move on to the lower bracket semifinals, awaiting the winner of DRX vs Team Heretics . Meanwhile, Fnatic's Champions 2024 campaign and 2024 VCT season comes to an end. They claim a 5th-6th place finish and end the season with the EMEA Stage 2 trophy on their shelf."

Icebox was Leviátan's map pick, while Heretics picked Lotus, which left Haven as the decider.

Moving to the defense side, Heretics lost both pistols and the bonus round to see their lead disappear. It was the star duelist of aspas that led the comeback, stepping up on Raze and improving from his passable performance on Icebox.

EDG has advanced to the upper final against the winner of Team Heretics versus LEVIATÁN , while Sentinels have been sent down to the lower bracket and will face FNATIC tomorrow with their tournament lives on the line. This match represented the first ever face-off between the two regional heavyweights after both had taken clean 2-0 wins in their first playoff games. The winner would claim their first top-three placement at a Champions event. EDG opened their map pick of Haven with their first of many pistol rounds, but the initial lead was short-lived as Sentinels answered back with seven rounds in a row. Everything went their way as they consistently dismantled EDG's defensive setups. TenZ in particular dominated the first half with 17 kills, including a clean three-piece in round 12 to secure his team an 8-4 lead. TenZ couldn't lose a fight on Haven. EDG collected the second pistol but were immediately thriftied after CHICHOO was caught isolated with a Bulldog. The Chinese team showed signs of life, including an impressive four kills from S1Mon in round 16, but Sentinels' lead was too much to overcome and the Americas squad closed out the map 13-9. While the headliner duelists in zekken and ZmjjKK both recorded 23 kills, zekken's impact as the spearhead far exceeded his counterpart's as he delivered 9-1 FK/FD compared to ZmjjKK's 5-6 FK/FD. On Lotus, Sentinels found another strong start as they went up 5-1. This time, EDG were able to wrestle back control, pulling the score back to 5-4 and an eventual 6-6 half off the back of a 2v3 from Smoggy and S1mon in round 7. Smoggy and S1Mon bring EDG back into the game. The second half saw EDG taking their first lead of the series as they chained a pistol and bonus win to a 10-6 lead, forcing a timeout from Sentinels. Sentinels brought it back to 10-9, but EDG maintained a stronghold on A to win the map 13-9 and take Sentinels to the first map three of playoffs thus far. That map, Sunset, wound up being the most one-sided of them all; EDG grabbed hold of a 10-2 attack half with a greater-than-usual emphasis on B postplants for the map. One of the only rounds for Sentinels was another thrifty win on round 4. CHICHOO comes online with three to extend EDG's commanding lead. The second pistol was the nail in the coffin for Sentinels; EDG found a 12-2 scoreline with a 5-1 pistol record for the series and won Sunset 13-6, closing it with a thrifty of their own. CHICHOO took over the entire server with 23 kills to 10 deaths, 333 ACS, and an outsized 1.72 rating. With this result, Sentinels will face FNATIC in the lower bracket tomorrow in a rematch of the Masters Reykjavik grand final and the teams' first meeting since LOCK//IN. On the other side, EDG have secured a historic win for China with the first ever top-three placement at a global event for their region. They will confront the winner of Team Heretics versus Leviatán in the upper bracket final as they push for VCT China's first international trophy. When asked about how he handles the pressure in the post-match interview, S1mon's answer was short and simple: “Focus on winning the games.” EDG will return on Aug. 23 for a chance at a coveted slot in the grand final."

    "cleaned_content": "FNATIC delivered an absolutely clinical performance in a 2-0 victory over G2 Esports in the first round of the lower bracket at Valorant Champions 2024 . They will face Sentinels or EDward Gaming on Sunday. The EMEA champions put up a levels-to-this performance in their first match against a North American team this year, dropping just 14 rounds in both maps, undeterred by whatever G2 tried to put in their paths. On Haven, the most dominant of the two maps, Alfajer delivered a 2.02 rating — a rare sight in international Valorant — and 24 kills in just 16 rounds. His ADR approached 300 and his mere seven deaths allowed for a 94% KAST on Iso. “They nerfed Iso, but they didn't nerf me. I'm still good,” Alfajer said. Unmatched. (Photo by Li Yicun/Riot Games) After that soul-crushing performance from Alfajer allowed his team to reach a 13-3 win on their Haven pick, the match segued to Bind. G2 put a much better performance on their own pick, though, and nearly pushed FNATIC to overtime. The map seemed to go the same way Haven did for the first half, as FNATIC took a comfortable 8-4 lead. G2 would not back down as easily, and broke FNATIC's economy as they reached an 8-8 tie. The match remained incredibly tight from thereon out until the final round of regulation, when Chronicle put up the highlight of the match. With just one chance to close out the game at 12-11, Chronicle and Boaster prepared for a 2v4 A defuse while most of G2 sat in showers. Boaster got a kill and as he stuck the defuse, G2's remaining three pushed out through the Cosmic Divide with a myriad of flashes, ignoring Chronicle as he blindly sprayed down all of G2 to find victory. Alfajer was a little cooler on Bind, averaging a 1.08 rating. The larger numbers went to his teammates Derke and Chronicle, at 1.25 and 1.36 respectively. The latter also found five opening kills in a total of 24, 17 of which on attack, making the difference in FNATIC's first half. The definition of spray and pray. This victory over G2 is a lifeline for FNATIC, after a sketchy 2-0 loss against Team Heretics in the upper bracket opener . That loss threw FNATIC into the lower bracket, a place they have never recovered from ever since their Masters Reykjavik 2021 run. “We had a long discussion last night. At least an hour, probably a bit longer, just talking about how we performed because yesterday wasn't good,” Elmapuddy told the analyst desk. “It was just ‘have a win Heretics,' basically, except for the second half of Abyss.” The FNATIC that entered the server today looked rejuvenated in a way they have not been in a long time. Their Haven was a show of unparalleled dominance and, after closing out a drawn-out Bind, FNATIC's confidence is certainly unbridled going into their next lower bracket match. “It's just the energy. If we have the right energy on the right days, I think we're really hard to stop. You saw in EMEA, we just steamrolled everyone,” Elmapuddy said. “The boys stepped up, people are fragging, they're talking, they have good energy.” Historically, lower brackets have not treated FNATIC well. Most recently, at Masters Shanghai , they were eliminated without a win to their name. They have surpassed that hurdle now, but Champions will keep FNATIC up against the ropes until they are either knocked out or get their hands lifted. “I told the boys if we can get over [G2], they're a really good team, we can beat anyone else that's left. We just have to keep the energy and keep going,” Elmapuddy said."

They have advanced to the lower round 2 match against the loser of LEVIATÁN versus Team Heretics , while Trace have been eliminated, placing 7th-8th in their first international appearance. Both teams came into the match facing the prospect of an early elimination after suffering 0-2 losses in their first playoff games, DRX losing to Sentinels and Trace falling to EDward Gaming . “We'll have to do whatever it takes to win,” MaKo said in the pre-match teaser . The match kicked off on Trace's map pick of Lotus, where DRX brought out their signature Chamber pick in the hands of Foxy9 in place of the traditional Killjoy. Despite consistently finding first kills onto Foxy9 in A Rubble, Trace were unable to find rounds as DRX won six out seven 4v5 situations, bringing them up to a seemingly effortless 10-2 half. The Korean squad won the second pistol round to convert a dominant 13-3 victory. BuZz commanded the server with a 1.54 rating, 21 kills to 11 deaths, 360 ACS, and a staggering 215 ADR. Flashback followed close behind with a 1.54 rating of his own and 14 kills to 6 deaths. Flashback takes down three to convert yet another man disadvantage situation for DRX. The one-sided story remained the same on DRX's pick of Abyss. LuoK1ng nearly clutched out a 1v3 on the first pistol, but DRX were able use bodies to block the Astra's Gravity Well from pulling the defusing player off of the spike. They utilized the same trick to narrowly win out the bonus round and ride the momentum to a 4-0 lead. Trace continued to lose rounds by tragic margins; in round 5, LuoK1ng just ran out of the bullets he needed to spam the defusing player in another 1v3 attempt. Trace managed to squeak out a few rounds largely thanks to heroics from Kai , but the first half ultimately ended 9-3 in favor of DRX. MaKo denies the Gravity Well to secure DRX the defuse and steal the bonus. Any hopes of a comeback from Trace were shattered as DRX collected their fourth out of four pistol rounds in the match and closed out Abyss 13-5. This time, it was the supportive players who thrived; BeYN topped the scoreboard on Sova with a 1.44 rating, 18 kills to 11 deaths, and 170 ADR. Foxy9 followed his teammate with a 1.30 rating, 14 kills to 11 deaths, 173 ADR. Looking ahead, DRX will face the loser of Team Heretics versus Leviatán in the lower round 2. If they win, they will advance to the top four and have the chance to play at the INSPIRE Arena in front of their home crowd. “We will put our hundred percent into our prep and the next match coming up to make sure that we play at INSPIRE,” BeYN declared in the post-match interview. DRX will return on Aug. 18."

The 2-0 victory sets Heretics up for a match against LEVIATÁN , while FNATIC descend to the lower bracket in an elimination series against G2 Esports . This series is the fifth time the teams have played each other, having faced off on three occasions in EMEA Stage 1 alone. This year, Team Heretics won the meeting twice, but FNATIC won the more recent, and more important, matchup in the Stage 1 grand final. In the veto, both teams continued with their previous bans: Icebox for FNATIC and Ascent for Team Heretics. Having similar map pools, the teams opted for different approaches in their map pick. FNATIC chose Lotus, on which they were 8-1 since the beginning of Stage 2 , while Heretics chose Abyss, which they tended to float but FNATIC appeared content to not play. FNATIC then banned Sunset, a strong map for both but common Heretics pick , while Heretics decided to take Bind off the table. This left Haven as the decider, FNATIC's 100% win rate map in the latter half of the season and a map which this Heretics lineup had only played three times. A 2v5 comeback gave Team Heretics the opening round on their opponent's map, Lotus . The anti-eco continued as expected, and Boo's Odin gave his team the bonus round. FNATIC turned their luck around in the anti-eco, and were able to exploit the B setup to win a pair of rounds. An oppressive round following a timeout gave the lead back to Heretics, with three more to follow as they forced mistakes out of FNATIC. The Heretics defense continued on their path to success, ending the first half 9-3. Wo0t makes impact kills look easy Team Heretics opted for a methodical approach in their attacking pistol round, with a flawless round putting them up to double-digits. In their bonus, they baited FNATIC into an early fight outside A, finishing the round out after cutting noise and continuing their push into the site. They won the final round with little resistance, winning the opener 13-3. With a now 28-9 historical record, the 13-3 scoreline is FNATIC's worst-ever defeat on Lotus. This improves on Heretics' previous wins, 17-15 and 15-13, as they now boast one-third of FNATIC's losses on the map. neilzinho was unconcerned about FNATIC's reputation on the opening map. “Lotus is one of our better maps; it was our best before Sunset” he said after their 13-3 win. “They haven't changed too much. We know what they're going to play and how they're going to react,” he added. “We also played really well; it helps when you do that.” benjyfishy agreed after the match. “I don't think we were the best prepared, but we shot very well.” Team Heretics extended their ten-round win streak on the second map, Abyss. RieNs gifted his team the pistol and bonus with separate triple kills, in turn leading to straightforward anti-eco rounds. FNATIC finally showed up on round 6, but they were unable to gain momentum, as MiniBoo won a 1v1 and then found a key opening kill to set the score 7-1. Identifying Heretics' lurking intentions, FNATIC were able to win their second point of the map. This began a back-and-forth, with the teams trading rounds and slowly adapting to the opposition's gameplan. In the end, Heretics set up a utility heavy post-plant, winning a 3v3 to end the half 9-3. hiro outshines MiniBoo with his own 3K FNATIC won a fourth round, their first pistol of the series, with a fast mid push and using a missed Heretics lineup to weaken the defense. An impossible 3K from MiniBoo was met with hiro 's own, as he clutched the bonus round to continue closing the gap. Heretics were able to win two more rounds following a timeout, but FNATIC continued taking rounds on the offense. Heretics used their second pause after FNATIC's tenth point. The defenders used their half-buy to whittle FNATIC down to a 1v2, but Derke was able to win the clutch and tie at 11-11. A late B execute turned into a hectic defense, putting FNATIC in the lead for their match point. RieNs single-handedly avoided the decider map, stopping the attacker's favored mid push and using his Hunter's Fury to find a fourth kill. RieNs avoided the decider map with a 4K Derke opened the overtime with two early kills. FNATIC left the opposite site open for a plant, and the remaining Heretics players were able to explore deep before planting, their forward positioning preventing a flood onto site and leaving the defuse without enough time. benjyfishy and RieNs continued their heroics, finding three to halt FNATIC's offense. The 5v2 was won with ease, ending the map 14-12 and closing out the series 2-0. “We all feel amazing. It's our first Champions playoffs win.” RieNs said after the series. “I want to be humble, but I don't think there's any team that can beat us,” he concluded. “We're just confident right now on every map; our map pool is super good,” benjyfishy added. The victory is Team Heretics' third win at Champions 2024, their debut in the marquee VCT tournament. It is also their second victory against a regional winner, as they defeated the Pacific title holders, Gen.G, 2-1 in the group stage . Heretics will next play against Leviatán, the Americas Stage 2 winners. The winner of the series will move on to the upper bracket final and guarantee a top-three finish. FNATIC, meanwhile, will play against G2 Esports in an elimination match."

    "cleaned_content": "In a meeting between two of the Americas region's best teams, LEVIATÁN defeated G2 Esports 2-0. The two-map series was played out on Icebox and Abyss. Icebox was Leviátan's map pick, while Abyss was G2's pick. Leviátan won Icebox 16-14, and then ran away with Abyss 13-5. Icebox is one of Leviátan's best maps this year. Entering Thursday, they were 12-3 on the map, but two of those three losses came against G2. G2 came out with the zero-duelist team comp that they've often played on Icebox this year, which puts icy on Gekko and leaf on Killjoy. G2's in-game leader valyn orchestrated a fantastic start to the opening rounds of the map, pushing and pulling at the Leviátan players to bring them to a 5-1 lead early on. A moment of heroism from Leviátan IGL kiNgg , with his team down 3-6, helped level the playing field for his side, despite him being detained by icy's Gekko Thrash. kiNgg and tex hold down B main. G2's attack-side game plan of avoiding the gun barrel of aspas was successful. The duelist finished with just one operator kill on the map. Facing an 8-4 deficit at halftime, the reigning Americas champions had their work cut out. When the teams switched sides, the keys were put into kiNgg's hands. Leviátan continued to play well in the gun rounds, despite falling victim to two G2 thrifty rounds. The map was razor-thin, with very little separating the two teams. G2 claimed four defensive rounds after their opponents came out with a hot 7-1 start to the half, bringing the two teams to 12-12. The last time these two teams went into overtime on Icebox, G2 prevailed 14-12. The trend of this match being attack-sided continued into overtime. In round 29, with the teams knotted at 14 apiece, Leviátan clinched a close round, giving them an upper hand to clinch the map 16-14. After a shaky showing on their map pick, the Americas champions dominated G2 on their own pick. An early 4K from LEV kiNgg helped set the tone for a Leviátan win. Leviátan owns a 66 percent win rate on the defense side of Abyss, and that percentage stayed put, with the half ending 8-4 in their advantage. On the map, the play of C0M and kiNgg locked down the A site on defense. Both players finished at the top of the team's leaderboard, with 20 and 19 kills, respectively. After Leviátan won their opening pistol round on the attacking half, all five of G2's players ran off of the map . The puzzling decision didn't pay off, as Leviátan converted their following bonus round to go up 11-4. From that point forward, Leviátan was cruising. Despite duelist aspas only finding one first blood across both maps, his supporting cast shone through, guiding the team to a 13-5 victory and a 2-0 series sweep. G2 head coach JoshRT chalked his team's performance on Abyss to being a byproduct of the Icebox result. “We lost a close one. I could tell the nerves were a little high. Going into the next game, we tried to mentally reset, and you just forget a few things,” he said. No members of G2 finished Abyss with more kills than deaths. “[Leviátan] is such a good team that they'll capitalize and they'll punish you for making those mistakes,” he went on to say. tex , a former teammate to many of G2's players having formerly been a member of The Guard , elaborated after the match that it was a fun one. “It feels amazing to beat them, not gonna lie,” tex said following the match. “They're my old team so of course there's always a little rivalry there. Not only are they my friends, but they're a good team so it's like beating my friends and a good team. It feels amazing.” He spoke on the friendship he still holds with many members of them, from joking with each other in the lobby to friendly trash talk before matches. “But it's never easy. Well, Abyss was kind of easy – for them, not for me,” tex said, motioning to his teammates sitting beside him. He finished the map 5-15. C0M, the last remaining member of last year's Champions 2023 -winning Evil Geniuses team in this year's competition, finished with a server-leading 42 kills, while G2's leaf had a team-leading 38 kills in the losing effort. Thursday's matchup was the fifth meeting between these two teams in 2024, with the Argentina-based team now leading the series 3-2. Less than a month after butting heads for the VCT: Americas Stage 2 trophy, Leviátan held their ground against Group D's top seed, and will advance to the upper semifinals. They await the winner of FNATIC vs Team Heretics , while G2 will face the loser in an elimination match."

This bout, a rematch of the China Stage 2 upper finals , kicked off a series of three regional encounters in the Champions quarterfinals. It was also where EDG claimed their fifth win in a row over Trace, a streak that has gone uninterrupted since late October, and a match EDG never even wanted. \"The reason is because we came from the same region. This kind of situation happened last year in Champions 2023,” CHICHOO said , mentioning their bout against Bilibili Gaming . “I didn't want this to happen again, but it happened. We're just gonna fight it.\" nobody was the playmaker on Bind from start to finish. (Photo by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games) EDG's fighting kicked off with three consecutive 3Ks from nobody , Smoggy , and ZmjjKK on Bind. They later ended as the team's best players, as the only three of EDG to claim over 30 kills across both maps — with KangKang in particular taking down 47 — while Kai was the only Trace player able to surpass that mark. That triple-threat start set the tone for the rest for both maps. On both Bind and Sunset, the perennial Chinese champions took a 10-2 halftime lead with strong showings from their own players. Trace bit back in the second half on both maps, though. With great focus on teamplay, they stole back five rounds on Bind before EDG were able to close it out 13-7. A similar story developed on Sunset, which KangKang kicked off with an ace. After their 10-2 lead, Trace bundled two streaks of four rounds to recover from an eight-round deficit to a one-round deficit at 11-10. ZmjjKK stepped up in round 22 and 23, saving his team from overtime with two 3Ks and closing out the match with a 13-10 victory. nobody's opening 3K on Bind was just the start of his stellar performance, in which he claimed a 1.60 rating and 206 ADR across 23 kills and seven multikills. He was second only to ZmjjKK's Sunset performance, where he racked up 28 kills and 214 ADR, despite a slightly lower 1.44 rating. Life is easier when you have KangKang on your side. Sentinels and EDG will meet at a crossroads in the upper semifinals. EDG look to go beyond the top six for the first time in their history, while Sentinels look to further their streak, solidify their best Champions run ever, and possibly achieve a second title this year. Sentinels sit on a three-win streak. Two of those wins came against the only two Korean representatives at Champions — Gen.G and DRX , both by way of 2-0 — and the third one over FunPlus Phoenix . Just like they have two wins over Korean teams, Sentinels now hold the chance to tack on a second victory against a Chinese roster. EDG won't go down without a fight, though. North America is the only region they have not drawn blood from, and the only one to best EDG at this year's world championship. EDG look to change that against Sentinels. EDward Gaming and Sentinels face off August 17, at 5 p.m. KST."

    "cleaned_content": "After surviving a stacked Group B by eliminating home crowd-favorites Gen.G , Sentinels continued on their march toward capturing the Champions trophy, defeating Korean team DRX 2-0. The two-map series was played out on Sunset, Haven, and Icebox, with Sentinels picking Sunset, DRX picking Haven and Icebox being the decider. Sunset finished 15-13, and Haven was 13-8, leaving Icebox unnecessary. In their two-map victory over Gen.G, Sentinels won all four bonus rounds off of four pistol rounds. On Wednesday, won just one pistol round and no bonuses. One of the viewing points of map one was zekken 's VCT debut on Neon, which included an ace in the first half, his first in an international competition this year. An ace for SEN zekken on Sunset. The five-kill round secured a fifth straight round for his team after trailing 2-0. He gathered the most kills in the server on the map, finishing 27-23, with eight of those kills being first-bloods. He'd even go 8-3 on BuZz , the opposition Neon. The second half of the map, Sentinels' attacking half, was tight. Several rounds finished with only one player standing. Up 11-7 and two rounds away from sealing the map, the script was flipped on Sentinels. DRX found five straight rounds to reach map point, but a lost 5v3 brought both teams to overtime. Eventually, Sentinels escaped their map pick by the skin of their teeth, 15-13. “It could have gone our way if we stayed calm, so I told the players to stay more calm and collected. Relax a little bit, take it slow,” DRX head coach termi said following the map. On Haven, Zekken again played Neon, seemingly looking to ride off of the confidence from the last map. Strong defensive protocols, along with excellent control of the map, highlighted DRX's successes in the first half. They showed little sign of being shaken, claiming six rounds in what's widely believed to be an attack-sided map. However, their attack half went differently. Sentinels seemed to have a read on DRX's attack processes, with a standout of their defense being their ability to hold A site. A flawless round 19, which included a triple kill from zekken, brought Sentinels to match point. Sentinels hold A site flawlessly to reach match point. They claimed six of the first seven rounds in the half to reach match point, and made quick work of DRX to win 13-8. “I thought [a win] was still achievable through every second of the [second] map, but when it was 7-12 and we had one person alive and they had four, that's when I felt it was over,” DRX's Foxy9 said following the match. After beating both Korean teams in the competition, Sentinels head coach kaplan spoke on the similarities between the two. “I think they're very similar. I think they both have a pretty structured way of playing. They don't have a ton of setups or plays, they prefer running the same stuff more frequently,” he said. Sentinels' Zekken finished with a server-leading 54 kills, while DRX's Flashback finished with a team-leading 39. “I was just feeling really Filipino today, so I played the Filipino character,” Zekken said jokingly when asked why the team chose to play him on Neon. “We've had Neon in our back pocket for a while. We have a good amount of prep with her and I'm feeling very confident with her as of late so we used her and it worked out well.” DRX are the last remaining team from the Pacific region in Champions Seoul after Gen.G, Paper Rex , TALON were eliminated in the group stages. Sentinels remain the only fourth seed to win a match at Champions Seoul, let alone reach the playoffs. With the field of 16 teams now narrowed down to an eight-team, double-elimination, Sentinels will await the winners of the EDward Gaming vs Trace Esports match, while DRX will take on the losing team. Sentinels, fresh off of having survived the group of death and four games into their Champions Seoul game, will move to the upper semifinals, while DRX, just three games in, will face elimination."

    "cleaned_content": "Disguised ended the VCT 2023 season as a struggling tier two team in the North American Challengers scene. The roster changes throughout the year took a toll on the team as the intrigue the organization built by joining the Challengers scene diminished. Now, one year later, Disguised is competing in Ascension Pacific for the chance at a spot in franchising, leading the pack in organizations owned by content creators. Disguised owner and popular streamer Jeremy “Disguised Toast” Wang decided to take his earnings and start an esports team with a roster in Valorant. While other esports owners have kept their privacy and supported their teams from a short distance, Toast was more involved, from speaking on the financial realities of operations to watch-partying games with other content creators. Disguised Toast, wearing his 2024 Disguised hoodie. (Image via Disguised) In 2023, Toast decided to start the Valorant team locally in North America. The original roster had evident talent, but frequent roster changes caused issues as the season progressed. Even the big-name pickup of yay didn't help as the team ended their campaign with an 11-match losing streak. The team was relegated from the Challengers league, leaving their future muddled. Toast eventually parted ways with the old roster and moved Disguised to Challengers Malaysia/Singapore for 2024. Disguised then officially became a partner team with BLEED to mutually grow both teams' communities on a larger scale, while also offering some connections to regional talent. Disguised started strong in Malaysia/Singapore and made savvy moves to stay a contending regional team across both Splits. It could've hurt the team much like their problems in 2023, but the timing of the situation worked out better the second time around. “Our attempts to solve issues with our first team was with roster changes, for a multitude of reasons,” Disguised Toast said to VLR.gg. “We had to do it to our APAC team this year as well, between Splits 1 and 2, but the NA team's changes were more often. We've seen it work before, like when Evil Geniuses swapped in Demon1 and BcJ mid-season and won Champions, but we've also seen it fail. Those changes in both years were the most prevalent growing pains.” Moving from NA to Malaysia/Singapore was a prudent financial decision. Base salaries were cheaper in Malaysia/Singapore, leading to less spent costs while the team earned more in competition. “We're spending less overall than last year, and looking back, it felt like I didn't need to jump in financially at that high of a bar that early on,” Toast said. “We're still in the red overall, but with these changes, there have been months we've broke even. The goal is to be somewhat sustainable in Challengers, and if we win Ascension and make it to tier one, we can entirely self-fund.” The Split 1 team for Disguised in 2024. (Image via Disguised) With a set goal in mind, Toast was excited about the new version of Disguised. After deliberation, Disguised chose head coach alexRr , just missing out on Fnatic coach Elmapuddy and Leviatán coach Itopata respectively. Ascension Pacific winner Juicy signed soon after, as he couldn't join any franchised team until he turned 18. The roster formed with a newly updated core of local talent led by JayH and bryce , and to start the year, Toast had a talented squad with high hopes. “I was expecting us to win the region and make Ascension,” Toast said. “I know there are a ton of cracked aimers in the region, but I also saw an opportunity to join a region where we would be considered a bigger org in comparison to our stature in NA, which also allowed us to get bigger name players more easily. I think we met our expectations, and at this point, I'm just happy we're making it to Ascension.” While three players were swapped mid-season , both Juicy and wayne were the two players who stuck around for the whole 2024 season. The team took time to adjust in the Split 2 regular season, and solid coaching allowed Disguised to hit their stride in playoffs and win the Split 2 playoffs. Disguised manage a big comeback to secure their grand finals spot. Toast watched as his team fought for a 12-4 comeback on Bind and a reverse sweep against ELEVATE and former Disguised player Riza . Thankfully the end was favorably anti-climactic, as his team swept the grand finals to earn their Ascension slot. Heading into the tournament, Juicy has the chance to be a back-to-back Ascension winner. While his age had prevented him from joining a franchised team in 2024, his experience proved key for Disguised, especially in the team's victorious playoff run. “Juicy has been a good stable presence for the team,” Toast said. “He's been through it all, and this season, he and Vera were competing and top-fragging as two star duelists. During playoffs though, you can see how his experience kicked in, and he had his best form of the season when it mattered the most. That calmed the entire team down, knowing that he can lock in when he needs to.” When he secured the Ascension slot, Toast felt relief. The expectations of winning the region were met, especially after the mid-season changes. Now, the team will compete in Indonesia for their chance at promotion to VCT Pacific, with Toast just hoping for a good show and a run lasting longer than a few games. Disguised winning Ascension could mark a storybook ending for the Malaysia/Singapore Challengers league, as it will shift alongside other tier-two regions to form the Southeast Asia region starting in 2025. Yet, for Toast, this win can also finish the ultimate organizational climb from cursed to contenders."

The full patch notes for both platforms have been reproduced below. ALL PLATFORMS GENERAL UPDATES Made improvements to how overlapping interactable objects work. You should now perform the desired action more consistently. For example: A dart from Cypher's Spycam should no longer prevent you from attaching to a rope if you're directly looking at it AGENT UPDATES Ground Spreading Abilities We're making improvements to abilities that spread along the ground like Brimstone's Incendiary and Viper's Snakebite. Previously, these abilities had inconsistent effects depending on the exact location they landed, ranging from extremely different sizes or damaging through walls and in areas the ability wasn't visually present. With this update, these abilities should spread more consistently and only apply damage in places that are consistent with the visuals. Map Targeted Abilities Improvements You can now ping and see additional icons on maps used for ability targeting Affected abilities: Brimstone's Sky Smoke and Orbital Strike, Clove's Ruse, and Omen's From The Shadows Sage's Barrier Orb Barrier Orb's placement preview now also shows up on the minimap PERFORMANCE UPDATES Improved the performance of Iso's Kill Contract ability. BUG FIXES General Fixed issue where opening menus would reset your toggle crouch / toggle walk state. Gameplay Systems Fixed a bug where pinging guns on the ground was not displaying the gun's name in the text feed. Fixed a rare bug that resulted in the defuse timer showing up as ‘-00.00' if the Spike was defused as the round timer hit 0. Fixed an issue with Ability icons not appearing on the minimap as an Observer. Fixed an issue where in certain scenarios, you can see an enemy but they don't appear on the minimap. Fixed an issue where \"DAMAGE TO YOU/YOU DEALT\" is overlapping the Combat Report widget. Fixed font size readability issues with Combat Report in certain languages. Fixed an issue with auto re-scoping for Outlaw, Marshall, Operator staying active while the gun goes through a reload. Maps Abyss Fixed a spot in Mid Library where thrown abilities can clip through the shelves into gameplay space. Fixed a spot where Agent utility could be thrown off the map and used as a platform. Revised the message from the Scions of the Hourglass to fix text errors. Fixed a minor visual issue for the railings around Defender Spawn. The Range Fixed a bug where certain words in the Range were not being translated correctly into various languages. PC BUG FIXES Client Combat Report Fixed a bug where during pre-round, [Tab] must be held down while pressing the cursor toggle button to enable the cursor. CONSOLE MAP UPDATES Pearl enters Unrated & Swift Play queues. KNOWN ISSUES General Fixed issue where opening an Ability map and the Shop/Scoreboard simultaneously could result in a loss of input.

The decision, according to Daeda, is one that has been on the cards for a while. “Going into the T1 project for 2024, I was fairly confident early on that it would be my only season with T1 as rumblings of a domestic focus was planned for 2025,” he said, revealing some insight into what the offseason may look like for T1's roster. Daeda also announced he is looking for a staff role in a team, whether it be as a coach, analyst or manager. He also stated that he is “looking to support another project going into next year, regardless of level or region.” Before joining T1, Daeda worked as a head coach for Turtle Troop as a head coach, and TSM as a head coach and data analyst. The move is one of many in what's been a busy offseason for T1, which began with their failure to qualify for Champions Seoul . Before the beginning of Pacific Stage 2 , the organization picked up restricted free agent and long-time DRX player stax , while benching Rossy . Since then, Sayaplayer has announced his restricted free agency, while Rossy also announced that he is looking for a team. Rossy announced that while he is a restricted free agent at the moment, the organization will be terminating his contract in the near future.

What was the thought process behind the back-to-back timeouts? alecks: \"We were just trying to calm down. The first time, I was trying to figure out what we can do about the A site. I think I told them the wrong thing, I think we should've played a little more defensive, but I told them to try and fight them. That pretty much cost us the game.\" Given this is given the fact that this is the sixth time PRX has faced EDG, what were some of the challenges that EDG threw upon Paper Rex for today's match, and how did it affect the team's showing today? f0rsakeN: \"I would say last time we were crazier than them, but now I think they just became crazier than us.

EDward Gaming are now in playoffs , their fourth appearance in the knockout stage since China's inclusion in the VCT circuit. Paper Rex are eliminated from Champions contention, leaving Pacific with only one representative, DRX , in the tournament. This series is the sixth time both teams have played against each other, with Paper Rex coming out on top in four of their five previous series. Additionally, both teams had placed in the top eight at every international event since LOCK//IN. The map veto began with Bind and Haven off the table. EDward Gaming picked Icebox, while Paper Rex took the series to Sunset. Ascent and Abyss were banned next, leaving Lotus as the decider series. Including all of Stage 2 and previous Champions matches, the two teams had nearly identical map pools, meaning the veto did not necessarily favor either team. With both teams at a 50% win rate on Icebox, Paper Rex's recent results on the map likely gave EDG confidence in the pick, while PRX's own 6-0 record on Sunset left it as a no-brainer for them despite EDG's similar 3-0 streak . “We want to present a beautiful match to all viewers,” ZmjjKK said prior to the series. “We're always friendly, as long as KangKang doesn't [pose against us],” f0rsakeN added. “If he does, something will do it too.” The match began on Icebox , with an aggressive push into B backsite and a something 4K winning the opener. Paper Rex won the following two rounds with few complications, but EDG took their first round in the eco. Another Paper Rex round led to a timeout from the opposing coach, Muggle . Despite keeping rounds close, PRX continued extending their lead. A scrappy round from both sides was on of few times Paper Rex faltered on Icebox By the end of the half, EDward Gaming had won a couple of rounds, first thanks to a Viper's Pit and then by punishing a misplaced Sage Barrier. PRX remained in the lead, converting a 3v5 on the pistol and leaving their opponents helpless for the next round and drawing out EDG's second tactical pause. Two early fights on A followed, which the Southeast Asian team won comfortably to close out map one 13-3. “They always change their strategy when they play against us,” Muggle said before the second map. “So we'll just go on our instinct and reaction.” Moving onto Sunset , a rapid counter prevented EDG's plant, giving Paper Rex the pistol. PRX denied a mid play to win the anti-eco, but the rifle advantage was too strong to overcome in the bonus round. Patience paid off for the top China seed, who were able to string together three rounds and force a Paper Rex timeout. Three questionable rounds followed, but Paper Rex were able to recover and take the lead. EDG took two to hurt the opposition's economy, but the half ended 6-6 after a successful retake. EDG's utility helps win the bonus round The second pistol round came down to the wire, as Paper Rex were close to converting a 2v4 after a quick lurk through mid by d4v41 . EDG narrowed the fight down to a 1v1, which S1Mon won. nobody and Smoggy were key the next three rounds, as they combined their utility to prevent PRX from gaining any advantage. The duo ended the defensive half with 13 eliminations and over 230 ADR apiece, with a 1.81 and 2.16 rating, respectively. The attackers finally won a pair of rounds to set the score 11-8, but Smoggy helped damage their economy, leaving Paper Rex with a half buy for the final round. With weakened opponents, EDward Gaming won Sunset 13-8 and tied the series 1-1. The Chinese roster remained on track to kick off the decider map . They punished an early defensive push to win round 1, and eased into A to take the next pair of rounds. A timeout helped Paper Rex get a read on their eco, but their weaponry was too weak to win the round. Their low credits forced them to save a round later, which left alecks dissatisfied. He burned the team's second tactical pause, a much needed reset for his squad. Paper Rex finally showed up on the scoreboard with two comfortable round wins, but CHICHOO and ZmjjKK returned momentum to the attacking team, forcing Paper Rex onto a half buy for round 10. Eventually, an indecisive round from EDG helped PRX win a third round, but the China representatives recovered in their last attack round, baiting out important utility to set the score 9-3 ahead of the break. nobody and Smoggy continued their dominance in the second half, with CHICHOO cleaning up the crumbs. They found back-to-back quadruple kills to reach 11-4. f0rsakeN found his own multikill to win a consolation round, but it was quickly answered by EDG herding the offense into C, where the duo-of-the-match laid in wait to shut down a late execute. nobody and Smoggy were the highlight of the series, crucial in their recovery the final two maps As if coordinating through match chat, both teams decided to fight EDG's match point outside of A. Paper Rex were able to draw out defensive utility, in exchange for better positioning for EDG. A second fight ensued, costing PRX three players but breaking through their first obstacle. nobody's quick flank was shut down, leaving a 2v1 and A free to plant. Smoggy remained unaccounted for, however, and he used a Meddle on default, leaving the plant weak enough to be sprayed down through the smoke. This ended the map 13-4 and the series 2-1, sending EDG to playoffs. Following the series, Paper Rex have now been eliminated from Champions 2024. This is the first time they have failed to make it out of a group stage since Champions 2022 , and only the third time they have been unable to reach playoffs since their international debut . “We adjusted quickly on map two and map three,” CHICHOO said after the match. “We've played Paper Rex so many times that we were able to fix our mistakes on the last two maps.” CHICHOO confirmed they were expecting Paper Rex's comp change to counter EDG's agent pick on Lotus. “We predicted they would try this comp,” he stated. Before the draw show , he said he did not want to play against the fellow Chinese squad, Trace Esports . Unfortunately for CHICHOO, due to the random draw, seeding, and restrictions to increase match diversity, EDward Gaming will next play against Trace Esports on August 14 ."

    "cleaned_content": "Note: This article is a text summary of the Team Vitality vs. Leviatan post-match press conference. The full video press conference can be found here . What are Sayf's thoughts and comparisons between competing with Vitality this season and Team Liquid last season? Sayf: \"I mean, the season was successful in a sense. At the start of the year, no one imagined that we would even be here at Champions. We were working on very, very slow fundamental things and trying to find our groove. We said it would be a long-term thing and that we're going to try our best to be better and better, and we ended up at Champions. With Liquid, we qualified for everything, yes, and I would feel like it was successful in itself, but I didn't feel the same development journey as I felt here. It didn't feel like I was growing, and I felt that the people and the staff around me at Vitality directed me well, especially with the additions to the coaching staff. I'm super proud of the work that's been done, and I'm super proud that we kept it together and whether we fell here at Champions, it doesn't matter.\" Coming into the match, you guys started strong on Icebox. What went wrong in the last part of the series, and why do you think Sunset wasn't as competitive as Icebox? Gorilla: \"Overall, I think we hesitated a lot more on Sunset compared to Icebox. The calls were good, the micro was good, but we were a bit too slow, too hesitant to move into actualizing upon what we called.\" How was runneR and Kicks' experience at their first international event, and what are their biggest takeaways? runneR: \"It's been a great experience for my first Champions and first year in VCT. It's been a hard year, I've tried not to think of it as a hard year, but it's definitely been a hard year. I still have a lot to go through. It's really good to get this kind of experience, and of course it sucks to lose, and I wouldn't wish this feeling on anyone. I'll be improving on myself and everything in general for next year. I hope I can come back here and compete again. Kicks: \"I can say for myself that we had a lot of ups and downs this season. The beginning of the year was rough for us and didn't go as expected in a lot of the events, but I'm really grateful that we pulled through in Split 2 and I'm grateful to be here. It's a really good experience. It's my first year in VCT, so it's always good to actually instantly make it.\" What do you feel is your biggest takeaway from this whole experience, be it good or bad from your point of view, and how will you use that going forward into next year? Sayf: \"The biggest takeaway is that you can accomplish a greater task with very small actions from everyone. You don't need something super significant from an individual person. You need small things from every individual, it takes little to no effort to do these things, and you will by default play better in the games you are playing. That's my biggest takeaway, that every individual can do something small and make something great for everyone.\""

    "cleaned_content": "Note: This article is a text port of our live interview with trexx. The video interview can be found here . Entering today's match for the decider, you went up against Leviatan, the #1 Americas seed. Did you have any initial thoughts on the matchup? \"They lost to Trace as we did, so I felt we had a good chance to beat them in the best-of-three, especially I saw our veto against them because the maps were very good for us.\" The veto ended up being Icebox, Sunset, and Ascent, maps that both sides have looked relatively stable on throughout 2024. How comfortable did the team feel about the veto? \"As I said, I think the veto was very good for us. Everyone felt confident on those maps, including myself.\" There hasn't been too much time between the last match you played and today. However, your previous match was a convincing 2-0 over Talon Esports. How much of a confidence booster was that win heading into today? \"Yeah, especially since none of us won a single match in Champions before. It was a confidence booster.\" Even after being down 7-5 at the first half, Vitality found strides early in the second half with four straight rounds on defense. Was anything specifically discussed at halftime to help with this? \"I think we just adjusted good against their gameplay. They were just on one side of the map mostly, and I think we adjusted good most of the times. The only reason why we didn't close Icebox is because we lost some key rounds and it cost us the loss basically.\" Despite your early start, Leviatan seemed to find their way back in the game after round 17, evening out the game and eventually taking things to overtime. Was there any feelings within the team before overtime started about not being able to close the map out sooner? \"Definitely. As I said, I think because we didn't close it out when we could, it definitely snowballed into desperate calls. I don't think it was frustration calls, but it was definitely not the way we would close the game if it was a normal situation for us.\" Unfortunately, Icebox did go in the favor of Leviatan 14-12. Even after being up at one point, what went wrong for the team as the map progressed? \"We used to lose the first map in best-of-threes, and I think we felt fine going into the second map since it was our best map also. We felt fine going into it.\" Map two didn't start in your favor. After taking a timeout down 0-4, C0M stole your first round away with a 1v2 ace. Did losing that round and other similar 1v1 situations have any detriment on the team's mental? \"I think the main reason why Sunset didn't go our way is because us not closing Icebox affected us, and we just didn't play the way we play Sunset usually.\" Vitality had called both timeouts before the first half ended. What were the main issues on Sunset that the team came across? \"The main point was that hesitated a lot and didn't play how we normally play. We were scared and we didn't adjust in time.\" Ultimately, despite your elimination, it's been a great journey upwards for the team throughout the 2024 season. From being on a struggling KOI last year to qualifying for Champions with Vitality, what were your main takeaways from the season as a whole? \"We had a lot of ups and downs. We came here without really thinking of qualifying for Champions, but it was a good thing definitely. The main takeaway is to trust the process, as we had many good people around us and they helped us with the process itself, let's say.\" Additionally, you were a standout player throughout the tournament. So far, you're the highest rated Initiator of Champions. It's been a while since you've been to an international tournament: how does it feel for you to be back on the stage and carry such consistent performances? \"In general, I feel that I'm always comfortable on LANs, even though I don't go to most of them. As soon as I have a chance to show myself, I do it.\""

Leviatán have advanced to playoffs as the second seed from their group and their first opponent will be drawn later tonight. Prior to this match, both teams had suffered 2-1 upset losses against Trace Esports and taken comfortable 2-0 wins over TALON . Leviatán sought to claim their first international playoff berth since Champions 2022 , while Vitality continued to chase the first of their own. “One of us is going home, and that's not going to be me,” said kiNgg in the day 10 hype trailer . Leviatán's pick of Icebox saw constant back-and-forth swings between the two teams. Leviatán opened with the first pistol, which Vitality responded to with a thrifty round in round 5 using a full mid push. Leviatán stabilized to a 7-5 half in their favor with the help of their own thrifty in round 8 and effective B retakes. Leviatán take the lead off the back of an Operator collateral from aspas. The map remained on a knife's edge; Vitality made it to a 12-10 scoreline off of heroics from Sayf and trexx , but were unable to close it out. Leviatán rallied to secure four rounds in a row and take Icebox 14-12. kingg and aspas came online for Leviatán with 22 kills and 229 ACS for the in-game leader and 21 kills and 222 ACS for the duelist. trexx topped the scoreboard for the hornets with 22 kills and 225 ACS of his own. Heroics from trexx are not enough as Mazino closes out round 20. While Icebox was a brawl, Sunset was a stomp; Leviatán ended the first half with a 10-2 scoreline thanks to strong defensive setups and individual plays from C0M and aspas. Even when Vitality were allowed to plant the spike, they were unable to withstand the opponent's retakes. A stunning ace clutch from C0M completely shuts down Vitality. Vitality managed to take the second pistol round, but after a narrow failure to convert the bonus round by Sayf, Leviatán easily won the last three rounds to take Sunset 13-4. Every player on Leviatán put up impressive numbers on the map, with four out of five of them having more than 140 ADR. Mazino eked out the top rating in the server with a 1.45 rating, 15 kills to 12 deaths, and 169 ADR, while C0M barely trailed behind with a 1.43 rating and 16 kills to only 8 deaths. aspas ended the series with 36 kills to 26 deaths overall. With this victory, Leviatán have secured their first international playoffs berth as an organization since Champions 2022, while Vitality will end their first global appearance since LOCK//IN with a 1-2 record. Leviatán's first playoff opponent will be drawn later today. When asked who he would prefer to face in the post-match interview, C0M declared, “Give us anyone. We'll beat them.” Leviatán will look to follow through on C0M's statement when they return for the playoffs, which begin on Aug. 14."

You've made it to the top eight and will face either Heretics, Trace, or G2 in the next round. Is there a specific team you'd prefer to play against? Boaster: \"If I had to choose, I'd pick G2. The reason is that I don't think I've ever played against them in the entire existence of Valorant. It would be a fun match, and I've seen them at events ever since Iceland, but I've never played them yet. So, that's the match I'd like to have.\" You performed very well and seemed to be the standout player. What do you think went right for you to continue to play well, despite the shaky first map? Derke: \"Sunset has never been a good map for me, and it was a bit shaky initially. But I was like just like trying to communicate and help out others. I felt like we could have won despite us being down so much, but I also knew that I couldn't get tilted if I'm having a bad game. After we lost Sunset, I knew we had Haven and Lotus coming up, which are my two best maps, so I was confident in those.\" Despite a shaky start, everyone on the team had standout moments, like hiro's clutch and Chronicle's play with the Operator. How important is that for the form of the team moving forward into the future as FNATIC heads into playoffs, both physically and mentally? Boaster: \"Each player on our team knows how to win. Whether it be LOCK//IN or Tokyo, or EMEA for hiro, we know how to win. We know what we're capable of when we're feeling ourselves. Honestly, with our team since everyone is so good, we don't need one person to pop off consistently; we can take turns stepping up. That's the trust you need in your teammates. If we can stay positive and we can keep up a good mood and good comms, then that allows for someone else to thrive who may not thrive if we were to all go negative and start being quiet.\" Before the event, Boaster mentioned the team had zero expectations. Now that you're heading into the playoffs, have your expectations changed at all, or are they still at the bare minimum? Boaster: \"For me, I don't like expectations, so I'm not expecting anything. I'm just going with the flow and going in the vibes. I wouldn't be here if I didn't think we could win this event and do well. I believe in the players I have in front of me and what they're capable of and how sick at the game they are. There's so much potential in this team and these individuals. No expectations, but I believe to achieve.\""

Given the results of today and in general, how has the evolution of the team been throughout the group stage? keznit: \"KRÜ went through a really tough year. There's been a lot of changes such as the addition of heat and mta. We had a better year than 2023, where we qualified to Champions by getting into the top three in VCT Americas. We practiced really well, and obviously there are some things to fix for a better result next time. I feel that this roster has the most potential out of all the other ones. I'm a bit sad because this is the third year that I didn't get into playoffs, but I believe in the potential of the team for next time.\" How does mta feel about his performance as an individual? mta: \"I had a crazy year. At first I couldn't play, and all of a sudden we qualify for Champions and I'm playing in Champions. I have this reflection of it being a tough year, but given everything, such as the accident that happened with me and not being able to play at the start of the year, I'm still happy to get where I got and I'm happy in my performance as an individual and as a team.\" What was your overview of the series and general, and were there any big issues that you could pinpoint as the main cause of FNATIC's victory today? Atom: \"I think that we started the game pretty well, this team is full of qualities and strengths. But sadly, I feel as though we are not at this point where we can consistently play as we are supposed to play or consistently follow our protocols and our game system. Coming into the match against a team like FNATIC, you can't fail that. You need to be strong and consistent at what you do. Overall, that's what I think gave them the victory.\" The year was very eventful for Melser. You went from starting the year IGLing to not IGLing, then going back into the position. In the midst of this, you had to handle new versions of the roster with heat and mta being added to the roster. How are you going to look back at the year? Melser: \"I don't know what's coming next, but we're going to do our best. I feel both happy and sad, more happy if anything since I want to dedicate myself to Controller. I think maybe I could've done more, but I'm very happy with the responsibility of being an IGL. Today, we showed not only our best face but also our worst face against FNATIC. Our loss was because we didn't apply ourselves like we wanted to.\""

    "cleaned_content": "FNATIC have defeated KRÜ Esports 2-1 to qualify for the playoffs of Champions Seoul . With this result, KRÜ have been eliminated from the tournament, ending their season for the year. The series was played out on Sunset, Haven, and Lotus. Both teams took their map pick, with KRÜ taking Sunset 13-11 and Fnatic taking Haven 13-9. On the decider map of Lotus, Fnatic closed out the series with a 13-5 victory. Despite both these teams being part of the elite few that have attended every Champions tournament, the last time they faced head-to-head was all the way back in 2021, when KRÜ took a massive upset win in the opening round of the playoffs. While keznit , Boaster , and Derke were the only three players that remain from that original match, Fnatic were still out looking for revenge. “Now we have a chance for payback,” Derke said in the day nine hype trailer . KRÜ had a commanding start to Sunset, with a pistol and bonus round putting them up 4-0, which they extended to a 7-2 lead in the half. Fnatic struggled to find any success early on, with their first two rounds requiring heroic multikills from Chronicle . Otherwise, the rounds were all going in KRÜ's favor, including a 1v3 clutch from Melser . Fnatic fought back in the late rounds to bring the half score up to an 8-4 in favor of KRÜ. Melser clutches out the 1v3. KRÜ once again started off hot in the second half, as Fnatic's failure to close out a 3v5 in the pistol allowed them to extend their lead to 11-4, including another bonus round conversion off the back of a 3k from keznit. However, that would be the last round KRÜ would find for a while, as stinger play from Boaster and Derke would stifle the KRÜ momentum, and give them a chance back into the game. Fnatic rallied back six rounds in a row to bring the score to 11-10. A hectic thrifty round would follow, ending Fnatic's winstreak and putting KRÜ up to match point, where they would close out the map in the final round of regulation. keznit finds three on site to bring KRÜ up to 11. Looking to carry some of their momentum from the end of Sunset, Fnatic started out with a strong pistol win on Haven, with Derke finding three on the round. After the second round eco, however, KRÜ would go on to win the next six rounds, rendering Derke's purchase of the operator ineffective. It would take a thrifty round gamble stack on the A site to get Fnatic back into it, leading them to win the last four rounds in the half to tie the half score at 6-6. hiro holds down the C site. The second half, the attacking side for Fnatic, was utter domination. KRÜ had no answer to the Yoru and Iso double duelist composition, letting Fnatic rack up six of the first seven rounds of the half to get up to match point at 12-7. Fnatic would close the map out three rounds later, for a 13-9 victory. Derke took over on Haven, posting a 1.43 rating and a 21-11 kill to death ratio. Following their strong performance on Haven, Fnatic aimed to put up an even stronger performance on Lotus. Derke far surpassed his already impressive stat-line on the previous map, ending Lotus with an absurd 30-11 scoreline, 453 ACS, and a 2.07 rating. KRÜ was lucky to scrape away four rounds on their attacking half. Fnatic quickly ended the series in the second half, allowing only one more round for KRU before delivering the final blow. Derke sneaks around the door to find three. KRÜ have once again fallen in the group stage. They have not made it to the playoffs of an international event since their Cinderella run back in Champions 2021, where they originally took down Fnatic. Fnatic have earned their revenge today, continuing their Champions run into the playoffs, hoping to redeem what has thus far been a disappointing year for the team. “That's not what our team was made for,” Boaster said after the match, reflecting on his team's performances earlier in the year. He has his sights set on lifting the Champions trophy, the only one that eluded Fnatic in 2023."

    "cleaned_content": "Note: This article is a text summary of the Sentinels vs. Gen.G post-match press conference. The full video press conference can be here . There was plenty of anticipation and attention towards this matchup given that it was pitted between the winners of the last two Masters events. For this occasion, you guys were on the losing end. Just want to ask you in a general sense, what do you think was the biggest issue that affected the team in today's match against Sentinels? solo: \"Overall, I think losing all four pistol rounds would be the most significant factor today.\" Although you didn't win today, t3xture finally managed to get an ace on Icebox before elimination. How important was that round for the team's mental? t3xture: \"It was good in the moment, but we lost, so it didn't mean anything.\" Was there anything in this matchup that you weren't expecting or was there anything Sentinels did differently from your first matchup that caught you off guard for this match? solo: \"Not really. Nothing in particular. I feel like today, Sentinels played more calmly and more cohesive and well-detailed compared to us. We weren't able to play our game from our side, so I think at the end of the day they were the better team.\" What are your reflections on the entire year overall, and what do you think were your biggest takeaways, be it good or bad, that you'll carry from now until the start of next year? t3xture: \"We finished strong this year, having good results. If you start strong, you need to finish stronger, that's what's really important. Because of how Champions ended for us, I think it's a bit of a disappointment when it comes to the whole year in general and how we finished this season. Our main takeaway is that we need to be a stronger team, play more solid Valorant as a team, and make sure to stay focused until the very end.\""

    "cleaned_content": "In a win-or-go-home meeting between this year's two Masters champions, Gen.G and Sentinels squared off in the decider match of Group B, with Sentinels coming out on top. The three-map series was played out on Lotus and Icebox, with Lotus being Sentinels's map pick and Icebox being Gen.G's pick. Sentinels won Lotus 13-9, and Sentinels won Icebox 13-6. The rivalry between these two teams began at Masters Madrid , and it will continue after Sentinels put the last nail in Gen.G's coffin, ending their 2024 season in their home country. The loss is just Gen.G's third this season on the international stage, after carrying an 11-2 record heading into Saturday's match. Sentinels would grab an astounding four pistol, anti-eco and bonus rounds in the series, giving them an advantage. Days earlier, they managed just one pistol round against the Korean team in the opening round match. The duel between the only two teams to have touched an international trophy this season was not nearly as close as the form of the two teams may have suggested. Sentinels ended their attacking first half with a 7-5 lead, raising the question of whether seven was enough on an attack-sided map. A crucial 3-kill round from SEN Zellsis to hold down the C site. A few rounds of defense-side heroics from the likes of Zellsis brought Sentinels to map point, but a Gen.G timeout seemed to show the early makings of a comeback. The Korean team won three straight to make it 12-9, but an all-out brawl fighting for control of A main gave Sentinels their map pick. With Ascent, one of their strongest maps, being banned, Icebox was Gen.G's pick. Famously, Icebox was the map that Sentinels closed out map five of the Masters Madrid grand finals. On Lotus, Sentinels won both pistol rounds, both anti-ecos, and both bonuses. On Icebox, excellent retakes and utility usage saw the American team's lead bubble even when playing a man down. Gen.G got nine first kills but finished the map with just six rounds. Gen.G, who had been relatively strong following timeouts, called one in hopes of clawing back into the map. Down 11-5, and on a six-round loss streak, It looked as though Gen.G would be pushed to map point. A moment of heroism in a 4v2 scenario would give the Korean outfit their first win of the half. GEN t3xture's first ace since April 2024 Following the ace, t3xture 's first since April, Gen.G won five straight rounds, and finished their attacking half in much better shape, trailing 7-5. It's the same halftime deficit they faced on Icebox, in map five of the grand finals at Madrid. On their attacking half, Sentinels continued their dominance in the early-half rounds, winning their fourth pistol, anti-eco and bonus rounds of the series. That's twelve rounds earned of the 26 they'd need in a two-map series. In comparison, in their opening round match against Gen.G, Sentinels won just one of four pistol rounds. Gen.G head coach solo appeared to take responsibility for his team's pistol round performances. “We needed better pistol-round strategies from the coaching staff. If we had better strategies, we would have won more pistol rounds,” he said. Once again, Sentinels started their attacking half strong, grabbing four straight rounds. Gen.G clinched their sixth of the map the following round, but Sentinels responded to bring them to match point. Now one round away from reaching the playoffs, Sentinels grabbed the all-important round dominantly to win 13-6 – the exact Icebox scoreline they beat Gen.G at months before at Madrid A well-rounded performance from Sentinels saw duelist zekken finish with the most kills in the team with 40. Every player on Sentinels finished with more kills than deaths. Fan-favorite t3xture finished with a server-leading 41 kills, while teammate Lakia would leave more to be desired, finishing 9-30. Surviving the group of death by finishing with the second seed, Sentinels will move on to the playoffs, while Gen.G's 2024 season has come to a close."

    "cleaned_content": "Note: This article is a text summary of the Paper Rex vs. FUT Esports post-match press conference. The full video press conference can be found here . From your point of view, what do you think were the biggest obstacles that this team faced against Paper Rex? MrFaliN: \"I think the main part was that we were unable to close out Sunset. If we had been able to close out the first map, we might have gone into the second map with a different attitude. We lost a critical round when it was 11-9 in our favor in the first map. We made some questionable calls, and after that, the voices of the team kind of shut off. Everybody felt a bit silent, and starting off Bind in an unfavorable way also built up that frustration, which is why I think we lost the match.\" How does yetujey reflect upon his first year in the VCT, and what are your main takeaways? yetujey: \"First of all, no matter the result, I believe that we've come quite a few ways as a team. Both personally and as a team, I can say that I am satisfied. I would have hoped to have won Champions and advance even further, but I hope that it'll be an even stronger year personally and as a team in 2025.\" What was the main cause behind the team kind of falling off, especially at the very end of map one? Additionally, what was your reasoning behind choosing Sunset, knowing that PRX is a strong team on the map? Gais: \"Our reason behind Sunset was that before we came to Champions, we decided on a map pool of three maps: Lotus, Sunset, and Ascent. For Lotus, we selected it and lost the map in our first match while playing Lotus, which led to a loss of confidence for us on the map, so we went into Sunset. We knew that they were going to ban Ascent, which is the reason for our map pool. The reason we fell off towards the end of Sunset happened previously in our previous matches as well, such as against Heretics. We have been searching for the reason behind this late-game drop, but we haven't found it yet. Sometimes towards the end of matches, we tend to lose our grip on the game. We don't really have a chill player who can lead the rest, which causes us to fall apart towards the end of maps. cal moments. We as a team don't exactly have a high game sense compared to some of the other teams. We are in a sense behind because of that, so we have to offset that. We have to make up for that by studying and practicing really hard. As for another reason, we ended Shanghai in the top eight. Had we finished with a worse result, we would have maybe found some of the reasons why we were falling apart as a team, and then we could have practiced harder and more efficiently. Since we had a favorable result in Shanghai, it played against us for Champions.\" What are your thoughts on the season overall? You made it to Shanghai, reached the playoffs there, and reached Champions off of a pretty decent EMEA season. What are some of the biggest takeaways, both good and bad, that you've had within the team? How has the team has progressed throughout 2024? cNed: \"To be honest, I think we deserved to compete at Madrid. We lost to both Madrid teams in the group stage in pretty close games. I think not making Madrid was a good thing because it made us realize how much we needed to work on. When we missed out on Madrid, we understood that we had to work a lot harder. When EMEA Stage 1 started, we realized that we are not actually that deep. Maybe it was better for us not to advance out of the group stage in Shanghai because if we didn't manage to make it out, we would just work a lot and fix our main issues and it would be a lesson for us. Then, Stage 2 started and everyone was expecting us to possibly be EMEA champions. After the group stage, we lost both games in Playoffs and came to Champions and lost both games again. These four games were really close. The biggest takeaway for me is that we need to perform better in stressful and crucial situations.\""

You are going to play against EDward Gaming once again. What do you think about playing EDG for the sixth time, this time on your home turf? Also, what are your thoughts on their new roster with S1Mon? f0rsakeN: \"I think S1Mon is a really great player, and ZmjjKK is also the star player of the team. We are really excited to meet EDG again.\" You've changed your Bind composition so many times before this match, however you chose a more standard one today. What do you think is the advantage of this composition, and what was your consideration behind it? f0rsakeN: \"I think the way I see people play Bind, it's just more balanced with this comp, and it seems like everyone is comfortable with the agents. It's just more balanced.\" Despite the huge lead on Bind, FUT was starting to put up rounds in the second half, which led to a timeout at 6-11. What was discussed during that timeout to help close out the series? alecks: \"I don't remember exactly, but it had to do with how FUT players like to play and what we can do to counter that. I forgot to mention certain things earlier, so we talked about those and what we should do from there.\" With this victory, you are going to have a rematch against EDG in the lower bracket, a do-or-die match. Any words to EDG, and how is your confidence this time? Jinggg: \"We have played EDG many times, and every game is always really close and exciting. I'm really excited to play against them. They are a really good team, and now with the roster change, I'm really excited to play against their new roster.**"

    "cleaned_content": "Note: This article is a text port of our live interview with alecks. The video interview can be found here . Your opening match vs G2 wasn't exactly the best, not even hitting double digits on one map. However, you've had five days of downtime before today's game. What mistakes from your opening game did you look to patch up before playing against FUT? \"It's been a long season, so we didn't really have time to work on our map pool. There's always something to do, and even then, they tossed in Abyss in halfway through and removed one of our better maps, Split. So we had to spend a lot of time on Abyss, we realized that maybe it's not the right map to spend time on, and it showed against G2. So, I think we went back to the drawing board. We put a lot of effort into making sure that the maps we used to be good on, we're good on again, like Bind, Lotus, Icebox. We also tried to work on a little bit of Abyss, a little bit of Ascent, a little bit of Haven, so it was basically just brushing up the map pool.\" FUT is also a team that you've had experience with in the past. You've previously played against them in Champions 2023. Did you have any thoughts on the rematch today? \"I thought they made incredible signings, you know like yetujey and cNed. Those guys are super good, so I expected this game to be even harder, and it was. They almost took Sunset away from us. It's a map we're super confident on, so for it to be that close is a little bit alarming. I think the way they lost Sunset caused them to spiral out of control. It's not really that we were super good on Bind, but I think it's a mental thing. It was a bit difficult for them.\" Ever since you began using your Sunset comp, you haven't lost once. You have a 11-0 record on the map with this specific comp – what do you think makes it so strong for PRX? \"Comfort agents and a good understanding of the map. I think we were one of the first to play Sunset in the whole scene because we played in the AfreecaTV VALORANT League. So, you know how these maps work; you get confidence on the map, and then you build on it. You feel as though it's a map that you're comfortable on, and it builds. Getting early wins is very important, and it happened for us. Also, I think most people don't play with Sage, so it's very hard for teams that aren't used to it. We try not to scrim too much to avoid people getting used to it.\" Even with a 7-5 lead after your defense, FUT managed to start Sunset away from your hands with a 4-0 start to the second half. You called a timeout on round 16 as FUT took the lead for the first time: what did you discuss? \"That was a game plan change. We were trying to push really aggressively on the sites of the map, and they were running away from us. The boys recognized that, and I let them figure it out themselves after that. But I basically just told them what was happening and why we needed to either rotate or push faster. I gave them a few options, and they chose the right ones, thankfully.\" Did you feel any panic start to set in amongst the team after FUT got up to 11 rounds? What did you talk about in the second timeout to stop FUT's momentum? \"I don't think they were panicking, but I was panicking. We've had some really bad losses this year, and sometimes you can really see the mental state spiral out of control. I was more worried that losing the map would make them feel like they weren't good enough again, which is something we've been trying to address. But thankfully, I thought that they played for each other, and they were helping each other out. Recently, we've been a bit too concerned about individual performance, and each player is trying extra hard to contribute, which sometimes hurts their performance. It's good to see them going back to the way they were before.\" Despite taking map one 13-11, were there any problems you noticed and what, if any issues did you talk them through with the team before heading into Bind? \"I think I just let them ride the high. They were really happy to get our first map in Champions, also winning on a very comfortable map was very important. So, I didn't really say much. We just sat down, and I briefed them a little bit on what we should do in Bind.\" We have only seen Bind placed once for Paper Rex ever since Shanghai, and you opted to have it as your map pick for today. Why has the team been reluctant to play the map throughout Split 2 and what have you been working on until this point? \"I think losing with the Harbor has hurt us very much. It used to be something we were very comfortable with. I think we didn't put enough effort into it. Something about Fade just bothers us when it comes to playing Harbor on Bind; the scans are too high. We block ourselves off from shooting our own scans, which doesn't make sense, and we just get shot through smokes. That took a massive hit on our confidence. After that, when you go back to the drawing board and try to fit Yoru or Omen in, trying different stuff, you tend to spiral out of control a little bit. After losing to G2, we went back and we said, 'Okay, we've got to do something about Bind. Let's try the meta comp,' and decided to try something we're comfortable with. So far, so good.\" You entered Bind, your pick, with quite a bit of a comp shift, changing what were previously picks such as Yoru and Reyna to more meta picks with a double controller and initiator. Why did the team choose to change the comp heading into today's match? \"I honestly still want to run Yoru, but at this point, there's no time. This is one of those comps where you actually need a lot of time, like off-season kind of time. We cooked up a bit, but this season has been tight. Anytime you want to innovate, you're taking a huge risk, and I think we decided that risk is too huge to take at this point.\" Do you think the lack of footage against Paper Rex on Bind hurt FUT in today's matchup? \"Oh, for sure. I'm very sure they prepared for a Yoru, and when we didn't run it, it threw them off. You've lost your first map, and then after that, you have to suddenly play against a comp change. It looks like your game plan, if it goes wrong, sometimes it's super hard to play. I've done it before, got the game plan completely wrong, and the comp change completely throws you off. It played in their minds as well.\" The series ultimately ended 2-0 for PRX. After a rough loss previously, how do you feel about the team's form after today's performance? Do you still feel as though there are things that the team could fix? \"Of course there's stuff to work on. Lots, I think. But at least I think it's a return of confidence, I hope. The way we played today is good, and I'm hoping it continues. But I know that we're on a slippery slope. My opinion is that the players really want to perform well; they want to do right by everyone. Fans, haters, and me as well. That stresses them, and we're working on it, but I'm hoping they can feed off the energy from this game and try to go all the way. We really need to win the next game to get our lifeline back. It will help a lot.\" You're now set for a rematch with EDward Gaming, making this the sixth matchup against the two of you. How do you feel about going against them again, especially off the back of their relatively good showing against G2? \"The funny thing is, I think we've only played the same lineup twice in those six matches. Even now, they're changing, so it feels like we're playing a new team every time, either because we change or they change. I'm looking forward to it. I think they're deadly now. They've gone from strength to strength. Winning VCT China with a new player is a big deal for them. They had a big performance against G2; they could have easily won that game, and then we would have been in a really big problem. So, I'm lowkey kind of happy. It's going to be an even game. I'm hoping that we figure out how to play around ZmjjKK.\""

    "cleaned_content": "Paper Rex have defeated FUT Esports 2-0 in the Group Stage of Champions 2024 , eliminating FUT from contention and ending their season. Paper Rex will go on to play EDward Gaming to decide the final team going to playoffs. These teams previously faced off in the opening round of playoffs at the previous Champions in LA , where Paper Rex took a decisive 2-0 victory. Back then, the teams were fighting for a chance to make it deep in the bracket. Today, both teams were coming off 0-2 losses in their opening matches of the group stage and looking to bounce back and stay alive in the tournament. The match would be played out on Sunset, Bind, and Lotus, a map pool that on paper favored Paper Rex. The Pacific team won Sunset 13-11, and took Bind 13-6 to win the series in two maps. Surprisingly, it was FUT who elected to pick Sunset as the first map, which had been Paper Rex's strongest map all year and one they had won the last 11 games on. However, FUT was prepared for what their opponents were bringing to the table, and were determined to end that win streak. The first half of Sunset was an intense back-and-forth affair, with neither team able to combine more than two consecutive rounds. It started with a 1v3 pistol round from d4v41 , but thrifty rounds and narrow victories ensured that neither team was able to build up any momentum to mount a sizeable lead. yetujey was a standout player for FUT during the half, getting numerous multi-kills that helped win them crucial rounds to keep the score to a close 7-5 in favor of Paper Rex. A quick three kills from yetujey to disrupt the Paper Rex attack. In the second half, FUT was finally able to put together a string of rounds on their attacking half, as a pistol into bonus conversion allowed them to take a 9-7 lead, their first of the map. Paper Rex were looking shaky, with many rounds devolving into them peeking into the FUT players one by one, leading to easy post-plant victories for the Turkish squad, keeping them ahead 11-9. However, round 21 would be a turning point for Paper Rex, as d4v41 and something combined their Wingman and Barrier Orb to counter the popular Sunset-B-Main post-plant and sneak out a defuse on the spike. This would be the turning point for the map, as Paper Rex went on to win the next three rounds to close out the map 13-11. The wall and wingman combo from Paper Rex steal a round from FUT. The next map was played on Bind, Paper Rex's pick. The team had been trying out numerous different compositions on the map, using three different comps in their last three times playing the map. Today, they once again chose something new, but instead of the unique Paper Rex style agents that they usually play, they decided to use something more standard, resulting in a mirror match with FUT. When asked about the change in comp after the match, d4v41 echoed the team's sentiment behind the decision. “This is our last chance to show that we deserve to be here, and let's go back to our default,” he said. Immediately, Paper Rex came out of the gates looking revitalized, jumping out to a 7-0 lead with their classic WGaming style working to perfection. FUT would fight back with two rounds of their own, but back-to-back triple kills from Jinggg and d4v41 put Paper Rex up 9-3 to close out the half. d4v41 finds three to bring the score up to 9. A second pistol win for Paper Rex gave them an even greater 11-3 lead, putting the map far out of reach for FUT, who only managed to rally three more rounds before being sent home. Throughout Bind, Jinggg was absolutely dominant, putting up 21 kills, 8 first kills, and a 1.32 rating, the highest in the server. mindfreak closes out the match with a crisp two kills. This winless result comes as a disappointment for FUT, who recently had their highest placement yet, coming in the top six of Masters Shanghai . Both teams had their sights set on winning the championship, but that dream will end for the Turkish team with this loss. Paper Rex will move on to face EDward Gaming in the decider match for playoffs. This is the sixth time the two have faced each other, having gone toe to toe at every international event since the debut of the Chinese team, barring LOCK//IN."

The two-map series was played out on Lotus, Sunset and Bind, with Lotus being Talon Esports's pick, Sunset being Team Vitality's pick and Bind being the decider. Team Vitality won Lotus 13-6 and Sunset 13-8, making Bind unnecessary. Team Vitality started on Lotus up against a unique Talon Esports team comp but found several gaps in the defense of the Thailand-based team. Great, fundamental team play was the highlight of Team Vitality's play on the opening map. Cohesive teamplay saw them scrape together rounds that otherwise would have been guaranteed wins for Talon Esports. Of the 11 rounds that Talon found man advantages, they would lose eight. “The fact that we have leads is good. The throws continue to be bad. Unlucky,” FrosT said in his on-stage interview following the map. Vitality dominated on their attack half, which was highlighted by a three-round streak in which they won consecutive 3v5 rounds. trexx , who finished with the most kills in the loss to Trace Esports, finished the map 19-10 on Fade, but the standout performance was that of rookie Kicks , who finished 22-9 on Breach. He'd also find his first ace in VCT play, in flashy 6K fashion. Crucial 6K from VIT rookie Kicks to reach map point. Talon Esports's rookie sharpshooter primmie played Raze for the first time in his VCT career on Sunset. He'd be tasked with out-pacing Team Vitality's Sayf , who was on Neon. After grabbing six rounds in their defensive half, Talon won their attack half pistol round to claim their first lead of the series. The lead would be short-lived, though, as Team Vitality converted an anti-eco thrifty the following round. With their economy healthy and never really looking to be in a tough position, Team Vitality finished the map sprinting. They won seven of the final eight rounds, including five straight to get EMEA's no. 2 seed across the finish line. ceNder 's 4K helps bring VIT to map and series point. Vitality's Kicks would finish with a server-leading 40 kills. Talon's primmie would be the only player with a rating above 1.00, while all members of Vitality had a rating above that mark. Across both maps, Team Vitality's ability to steal rounds while playing shorthanded was highlighted. With the result, Talon Esports's 2024 VCT campaign is over. Team Vitality's continues, but they aren't out of the woods yet. On Sunday, they'll play against LEVIATÁN , the Americas Split 2 champions. The winner of that match will claim the second playoff spot in Group C, while the loser will go home."

    "cleaned_content": "DarkZero Esports have released their roster following their Challengers Playoffs loss and failure to qualify for Ascension , a decision confirmed by recent player announcements . After a season of growth and standout performances, the former Turtle Troop squad is once again on the market as free agents. Formed in early 2023, Turtle Troop aimed for a spot in NA Challengers . Despite a disappointing result in the open qualifiers, the team blazed through the LCQ, securing a place in VCL and a chance to represent North America at Ascension. However, their Split 1 began poorly, prompting two roster changes mid-split. These adjustments revitalized the lineup, allowing them to earn their first wins. Yet, this momentum was short-lived as new additions mummAy and TiGG , who played as free agents with TTR, were acquired by FaZe Clan for the next split. Although the team showed improvement with their new roster for Split 2, they failed to qualify for playoffs but managed to avoid relegation. Heading into 2024, Turtle Troop faced more changes after Rossy and Governor were acquired by VCT Pacific teams. With only wedid and Add3r remaining from the original lineup, ex-100T IGL stellar , corey , and bdog , rounded out the latest iteration. TTR started Split 1 strong, topping their group with a 4-1 record. Despite having to play with substitute silenx , TTR secured second place in the Mid-Season Cup in an upset win over M80 . Following this impressive performance, DarkZero acquired the Turtle Troop roster after nearly two years of free agency. Their red-hot form continued into Split 2, and DZ finished with a 5-1 record, leading the league in circuit points. Stellar, the only DZ pro to play at VCT Americas, at 2023 LCQ (Photo by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games) Beginning playoffs as first seed, DarkZero were a favorite to reach Ascension; however, they again had to play with a sub in their opener due to wedid's health complications. An early loss to Blinn sent them into the lower bracket, but wedid's return rejuvenated the team, leading to a win over FLUFFY AIMERS . The squad resolved to stick together, win or lose. Unfortunately, their next match against second-seed Oxygen Esports ended their playoff run and their hopes of ascending to the Americas League. All five players will be highly sought-after free agents for VCT and Challengers teams looking to rebuild, though wedid has indicated he anticipates remaining in Challengers due to ongoing health complications."

Can you give some reasoning behind today's loss? bail: \"I don't have much I want to say. We just came to Champions and there was so many ups and downs in our whole team such as through Stage 1 and 2. We've had a little bit of roster changes in our team, and I appreciate all of the players. They just follow us, and I think we made the decision in this super short period whereas KRU made preparation. I think the blame for the loss should be on me. Maybe the main reason is myself.\" How will you put your newfound experience to use for the future? Knight: \"I think we just tried a lot of new stuff at Champions. I think we just need more time to take things step by step.\" Looking back through the whole year, how was the progress on your individual and team performance, especially after bail joined? whzy: \"I think there is a lot of things. We just didn't play what we want, and during this whole year, we need to learn a lot of stuff. We just want to play our own stuff, and unfortunately we just couldn't do it.\" The team has come a long way to reach the point to qualify for Champions. Due to the fact that you had to join a bit later in the year, how do you feel about the team's progress since the time you joined? bail: \"The first thing I mentioned is that there were a lot of things I can't fix. Maybe I just need to focus on our mistakes, and we need to practice and practice and make things better. I think it's been a very long time that all of these mistakes have remained. We just need to take more time to fix it. I just want them to thrive.\""

    "cleaned_content": "Note: This article is a text port of our live interview with nephh. The video interview can be found here . Today's match was for elimination and you went up against KRU Esports. After watching their opening game against DRX, did you have any thoughts on the matchup? \"Before Champions, I was keeping track of their games in VCT Americas, and I think they are a very strong team. You know, they were the third seed, and they brought pretty close games against Leviatan, a very strong team. I know their style is more aim heavy and I think that's where we failed miserably today.\" whzy said in today's opening interview that “if KRU can play as well as FNATIC, then we'll go home. However, you're not”. How confident was the team in today's matchup initially, judging by the statement? \"For both games against FNATIC and KRU, we were pretty confident going into them. We knew they were both very strong teams, and it wouldn't be easy to take victories. Coming into today's game against KRU, we thought it would be a much closer match. After the veto came out, we thought we had a really good shot of winning, but our defense on the first map was very lackluster, and we weren't good at adapting to what they were doing. In the second map, we just got outplayed.\" The game kicked off on Lotus – a map BLG previously lost 4-13 to FNATIC in your opener. What were some of the main mistakes from the match you looked to fix with the downtime you've had since the loss? \"Against Fnatic, we were running a Cypher composition, but after the game, we realized it wasn't playing to our strengths. We have a really good Viper player, so we decided to change the composition. That helped us a lot on our attacking side, and we could have won more rounds, but we got thriftied one or two times. We knew the defense side was going to be hard with this composition, but we thought we'd be okay and able to fill in the holes. Unfortunately, we weren't as good as we thought we would be.\" Defense didn't start your way with four in a row going for KRU: what did bail cover in the round 17 timeout and why did things still not work out for BLG afterwards? \"In the pistol round, we lost, which was fine, and then subsequently the eco round and the first buy round. That's when the problems really started. We kind of forgot our game plan, and there were smokes being put in the wrong place and positions not being taken up correctly by the players. It's a team problem, in the end. After the timeout was called, bail told us it was time to change things up, and we tried, but after that, I made a big mistake on the first gun round after the timeout by not falling back into B Heaven and got stuck in A Link. I think that's where things really snowballed from there, and I think that loss was on me today.\" Lotus ended 9-13. As a whole, do you think anything else went wrong? \"After the first half ended, we were up 7-5. Other than the problems I mentioned, maybe it was just the lack of time we had for this new composition. That's not an excuse, just how I feel. They were really sharp, and our five individual performances weren't up to standard. I think that's where we lost the map.\" BLG has only picked Icebox three times throughout Split 2, with the map also usually being a second ban for the team. Why did BLG opt to pick Icebox heading into map two, despite not having many reps previously? \"We picked Icebox because we knew it was a map KRU wasn't very comfortable on. We were feeling pretty confident on the map, judging by our performance in scrims. I think it was the correct pick, even though the scoreline says otherwise. The first map loss really affected us, and going into the second map, our game plan was to play post-plants. We planted the spike many times, but due to our lack of communication during those situations, we ended up only getting three rounds.\" bail mentioned after the first map in an interview that part of the reason that things didn't go right on Lotus was because of some communication issues. How big of a issue was communication really in today's match? \"I think today communication was part of it, but the main problem was that we just weren't up to standard in our own performance, like our aim and decision-making. Although our comms were very bad today after the first map, back in VCT CN, our issues weren't as punishable because the teams weren't as good as the teams here at Champions. I think teams like KRU and FNATIC really punished us, and this is a learning experience. Now we know the importance of improving our communication.\" With the loss, your season is now over, and your contract ends with Bilibili Gaming soon. What do you think will be next for you in the future? \"I'm not really sure. I took a big risk coming to Bilibili Gaming to play in VCT and moving to China in general. I think it's time to give myself a short break before I think about what's next. I'm really burnt out from competing over the past three months. Coming into a new team and making it to Champions was a really good accomplishment, but I think we could have done better.\" You're also the first non-Paper Rex Singaporean to qualify for an international event, much less Champions. How does it feel to represent MY/SG on the global stage despite the results shown here? \"I felt really proud knowing that even though I wasn't part of Paper Rex, I was still able to compete, even if I'm not on PRX. I was really happy at first, but after today's performance and the past game, I realized I wish I could have done better to put MY/SG on the global stage.\" Your appearance here in Champions also comes off the back of an unfortunate end to your 2023 season, having to leave BLEED previously with National Service on the horizon. From being in Ascension to now proving yourself internationally, what are your main takeaways from 2024 as a whole? \"Ascension was really a big deal. In a sense, it's the biggest tournament of the year if you're not in partnerships. I learned a lot from Ascension. When I first played Ascension, I was very nervous and shaking during every game, but coming into the leagues for the first time, nothing really fazed me. I wasn't panicky in Champions or in the group stage back in VCT CN. I think I've learned a lot, mainly from Ascension, and I hope to carry what I've learned from this year and last year into the future. I hope to compete in the VCT again next year.\""

    "cleaned_content": "KRÜ Esports have defeated Bilibili Gaming 2-0 in the Champions 2024 group stage. They will next play against FNATIC for a spot in playoffs as the second seed from group A. Bilibili are now eliminated from the tournament, the second team to end their run. This matchup is a first for both teams, as they were drawn into, and eliminated from, separate Champions 2023 groups. The event was Bilibili's only other international appearance, as well as KRÜ's only other international tournament since LOCK//IN in early 2023. The map veto mostly favored KRÜ, who had shown relatively better performances across a wider map pool. Bilibili were forced to ban one of their better maps in terms of winrate, Ascent, and leave open weaker options. They did have a far better winrate on the decider map, Sunset, but the first two maps would be unfavorable regardless of how the selection went. Starting on KRÜ's map pick, Bilibili took the Lotus pistol round to kick off their attack. They won the anti-eco, and the teams began trading trading rounds. The pistol win kept BLG in the lead, but they called for a tactical pause when they were up 5-3. A 4K from Knight helped them win their sixth, but the traded rounds continued, as the teams went on to win their respective half-buys and ecoes from that point, ending the half 7-5 in Bilibili's favor. Setting up whzy was key for their offensive success, as he went 5-2 in opening duels and found two triple kills to win his teams a pair of rounds. Shyy celebrates after a bonus win gives KRÜ the lead After the break, the Latin American squad won the second pistol round without a single death. They earned a second flawless the following round, and took advantage of their economic advantage to take lead, pressuring their opponent's buy round and only losing two players during their bonus. heat and Melser helped their team extend their lead, going up 10-7 and forcing BLG's second timeout. A fumbled round left an opening for Knight to punish KRÜ, giving the attackers an eco round and burning KRÜ's first pause. The offense was able to take another two rounds, and a ninth for Bilibili was not enough to faze their opponents, who closed out their map 13-9 after a Shyy triple. KRÜ maintained their form going into Bilibili's map, Icebox. A quick keznit flank let him pincer the Chinese roster's pistol post-plant on B, which gave KRÜ a second pistol win. mta was valuable throughout the defense, finding a triple kill and two opening kills to extended his team's lead to 5-0. The gap forced Bilibili's tactical pause, which helped put them up on the scoreboard. BLG enabled whzy, netting him a 2K and catching his mirror off-guard to leave B open for the taking. KRÜ successfully retake into a Viper's Pit KRÜ were not shaken, as they managed to claw back round seven despite retaking into a pair of ultimates and post-plant setup. Two more rounds followed for KRÜ, which forced bail to use his final pause of regulation. Bilibili identified lurking as a possible weak spot in the defense, and they were able to leverage the information into back-to-back round wins. KRÜ's defense cleaned up the final round of the half, denying BLG any hope of building momentum. The Americas team forced a shootout on A to win the second pistol, and an empty B site gave them the anti-eco. keznit and heat helped take KRÜ's third bonus round of the series and reach match point. Flex1n was active, however, denying KRÜ their victory. Bilibili were unable to replicate their success, and KRÜ ended map two with a 13-4 scoreline. “This victory was what we needed,” Shyy said after the series. “We'll be more confident thanks to this win.” In response to whether their regained confidence would take KRÜ on a run, Shyy was positive. “Yes, of course,” he replied. “This is the beginning of something historical.” KRÜ will now play against FNATIC in the group A decider , a rematch of the iconic Champions 2021 series in which KRÜ eliminated FNATIC and cemented their run as one of LATAM's best-ever performances in a tier 1 esport tournament. When asked about their next series, Shyy mentioned his wish was granted. “I've always said since making Champions that I want to play DRX and FNATIC,” he said. “I want my revenge after Copenhagen .” Meanwhile, Bilibili are the second VCT China to be eliminated, following FPX's loss to Sentinels in the group B elimination match. Bilibili have failed to win an international series ever since they first eliminated NRG Esports in Champions 2023."

    "cleaned_content": "Sentinels have defeated FunPlus Phoenix in a 2-0 sweep in the group B elimination match at Champions 2024 to eliminate FPX and conclude their season. Sentinels advance to the decider match , where they will battle Gen.G for a playoffs spot. Coming into this match, Sentinels most recently suffered a substantial 2-0 defeat at the hands of Gen.G, while FPX just barely lost to Team Heretics in a 2-1 thriller that saw the third map go 15-13 to Los Niños. Sentinels would seek to recover their championship form after a disappointing performance in the Americas playoffs to push past their first-ever Chinese opponent. The match began with FPX's pick of Bind, where they defeated Heretics in their opening match using a unique Yoru and Chamber composition. Sentinels made one adjustment, with johnqt switching off of their previous Deadlock pick and returning to the standard Viper. After dropping the first three rounds to FPX, Sentinels won four attack rounds in a row with clinical ultimate cycling to go up 4-3. However, their attack rounds without ultimates fell flat; FPX quickly stabilized to an 8-4 half off the back of consistent openers from Autumn and multikills from Life . Life holds his ground and sprays down the opposition. Sentinels rallied to narrowly win the second pistol round. From there, they chained together nine straight rounds to close out the map 13-8, expertly exploiting the Yoru's inability to break through chokepoints with grounded crossfires on the sites. zekken came alive, topping the scoreboard with 20 kills to 13 deaths and 262 ACS; only Autumn was able to match him in kills from the side of FPX. johnqt clutches out round 20 to continue the snowball. On Sentinels' Lotus pick, FPX brought out yet another unusual composition, featuring a Chamber, two initiators, and no duelist. Sentinels returned to a standard composition, again substituting a Viper in for Deadlock. Without a duelist, FPX were unable to break Sentinels' defensive setups except when Autumn found an opening pick with the Operator or AAAAY used his Thrash to create space. Sentinels identified their opponents' weakness almost immediately and capitalized to secure a dominant 9-3 half. It fell to FPX to leverage their composition to come back on defense, but it was too late; Sentinels carried their momentum forward to take Lotus 13-5. zekken once again stomped through the server with six first kills and 288 ACS, this time supported by TenZ who matched zekken with 19 kills to 11 deaths. Sentinels claim their first international win since Masters Madrid in commanding fashion. With their loss, FPX is the first team to be eliminated from Champions. This performance comes as a disappointment after FPX closely challenged Gen.G and Team Heretics at Masters Shanghai. For SEN City, it doesn't get any easier from here; they will advance and face Gen.G for the second time this tournament in the group decider. One Masters Madrid finalist will advance to the playoffs and the other's year will come to an end. “It's been a while since we won a series, so hopefully we show a better form than what we showed Gen.G the first time,” said TenZ when asked his thoughts on the upcoming match. Sentinels will demonstrate whether they continue their recovery when they return to the Champions stage on Aug. 10."

Mikes first joined 100 Thieves as a part of their large coaching staff overhaul in the middle of the 2022 season. He was added as an assistant alongside head coach seangares . Mikes aided in developing the newly revamped player roster that took the organization to their first and only appearance at Champions in that same year. After the departure of seangares at the end of 2022, Mikes would step into the head coach role for the 2023 season, with former Cloud9 coach JamezIRL being added as an assistant. With an already international level core of players and the addition of star player Cryocells , many predicted 100 Thieves to be one of the strongest teams from the Americas region with the potential to challenge for international titles. However, the team failed to reach the same heights as the prior year, as they were unable to qualify for any international events, failing to even make it to the playoffs of the Americas league. Many pinned the roster's failure on the lackluster coaching staff, as JamezIRL had been removed from the team very early into the season, leaving Mikes as the sole supporting cast for the roster. For 2024, 100 Thieves brought on Zikz , previously part of the Champions-winning Evil Geniuses team, as their new head coach, with Mikes returning to the position of assistant coach. This change, along with the addition of eeiu and Boostio , breathed new life into the roster, as they soared to the top of Americas in Stage 1 , qualifying them for Masters Shanghai , where they would place fourth. After Shanghai, however, the team entered a slump, and were unable to qualify for Champions, following a narrow defeat to KRÜ Esports in playoffs. Mikes has announced that he will be looking for coaching positions in VCT for the 2025 season. 100 Thieves are now: Kelden \" Boostio \" Pupello Sean \" bang \" Bezerra Matthew \" Cryocells \" Panganiban Daniel \" eeiu \" Vucenovic Peter \" Asuna \" Mazuryk Anthony \" Zikz \" Gray (Head coach)"

We should also try to remember how to get wins when we get advantages in rounds. Additionally, when opponents change their pace, we shouldn't let them destroy our pace.\" What changed from the team in your point of view from the end of map one in comparison to maps two and three and how did it cause the loss to happen? ZmjjKK: \"When we take a lead, we kind of play in a hurry to win. Everyone thought that we should hurry up. We were too hurried and in a rush to win. That's what caused our performance and actions in the server, and this includes myself too. We should be focused on the fact that when we take a lead, we need to focus on how to keep our mentality stable and not be in a rush.\" Despite the loss, S1Mon had a very good performance for a rookie on the international stage.

What do you make of his calling, and how was your experience going against him? valyn: \"I give a lot of props to him. I think since he picked up the IGL role, EDG has looked a lot better. I knew going into this match it was going to be very difficult. In previous events, they haven't had the best placements or the best macro, but after watching their games in China and their matches leading up to this one, I noticed a lot of improvement in their macro. So, props to him, he's good.\" Analysts have joked that it takes you and your team kind of take one map to \"download\" your opponent and their gameplay before you adapt and adjust. Given some of the rocky map ones and consistent map three wins, do you think this metaphor is true? If so, what were some of the big takeaways about EDG that you used to turn the series around in maps two and three? valyn: \"I would definitely say it's true. If we end up winning a map, then I'm very confident that we're going to close the series. Going into map three when the pressure is highest, people start to make more mistakes, and that's when the best comes out of us. Sometimes map one, whether it's problems out of your control or maybe they have a better game plan, just puts you out of flow. We have to ease into the game, and we know each series is a long process. Just because we have a rough start doesn't mean the next two maps will be bad for us. That's when we shine the most, easing into the game and warming up into it.\" Can you walk us through any key moments or plays that shifted the momentum of the match in your favor, especially on the defensive side on Bind? JoshRT: \"It's been a blur honestly, but I feel like that round where valyn went out of Hookah and was able to get that 3K kind of stopped our bleeding on defense and turned it in our favor. I don't remember the exact score, but I remember it being a crazy play. valyn's highlights and taking over the game proactively put a stop to what EDG was doing.\" We know it was a very close game because EDG is a strong team. What aspect of EDG's gameplay did you find most difficult to counter, and how did you adjust your strategy to overcome this challenge? JoshRT: \"I thought their attack was excellent. The calling from nobody was really good in terms of putting us in difficult situations. They were able to do really strong executes and a lot of little fakes, ending in the late rounds similar to what we do. Having all those different styles put against us, especially on Bind, made it really tough for us, so we had to be a little more proactive to stop that.\""

They will now wait for the group stage to finish, with the knockouts beginning next week. EDG are now in the group D decider match , where they will play against either Paper Rex or FUT Esports for a second opportunity at playoffs. This series is the first time G2 have played against a Chinese team, having avoided the region during their local event, Masters Shanghai . The victory also guarantees one team from each region in playoffs, with DRX representing Pacific, Team Heretics from EMEA, and Trace Esports redeeming China with an upset win. The match began on Icebox , G2's map pick. EDG took an early lead, which they were able to extend despite forcing a tactical timeout from the opposition. G2 finally showed up on the scoreboard in rounds 7 and 8, where they were able to leverage their signature A-flank plays and ultimate economy to win the rounds. The Chinese squad was quick to adapt, however, as they were able to shut down both of G2's win conditions during the remainder of the half. EDG identified and shut down G2's win conditions on Icebox defense EDward Gaming were able to take the second pistol of the map, with G2 calling for their second pause after they lost the anti-eco. This set off a four round streak, where valyn and JonahP led their offense to success. icy was next with two key rounds, but EDG's lead was too much to overcome, and a quadruple kill from S1Mon 's anchoring closed out the first map 13-8. “There were some issues that we had,” leaf said after the series. “They played a really good game,” icy added. Haven began with another pistol win for EDG, but their opponents took over the opening portion of the map. EDG managed to stabilize by taking advantage of ZmjjKK 's Neon, who broke through the defense on rounds 7 and 9 with triple kills. This helped them go to halftime on a 6-6 scoreline. trent wins a 1v2 to slow down the comeback The NA team regained their lead after the break, winning their first pistol of the series. Their opponents answered back with five of their own, a streak only interrupted by a clutch from trent. Back-to-back-to-back triple kills for G2 stole match point away from EDG, and a round later G2 tied the series with a 13-11 win. When asked about their recovery on Haven, leaf mentioned their adaptation. “I think just discipline and realizing their win condition,” he said. “We just fixed our mistakes,” he added. “Made it pretty easy.” G2 remained dominant during the decider map, Bind. They took a second pistol win to start off, and despite EDG winning round three, valyn won a clutch to force his opposition into an eco. Following the save, EDG called for a timeout, down 4-1. The next round saw teams trade advantages, but S1Mon was well positioned to win a clutch of his own. The attackers' discipline helped set icy up for aggressive entries, breaking EDG's defense and extending their lead to 9-2. He ended the half with 17 eliminations and a 1.67 rating, his best offensive half in the event. EDG's rookie was one of the highlights of the series, but his performance was not enough to give his team a win Not content with an opponent taking the spotlight, CHICHOO won a half-buy 1v2 to give his team some consolation. The next round, his lurking through B enabled a quick rotation to win his team the second pistol round on Bind. An extra pair of rounds prompted G2's pause. The discussion led to them reaching double digits on the scoreboard, but hero rounds from S1Mon and Smoggy stopped any semblance of momentum for the North American squad. EDG started to regain control for their attacking half, but G2 were able to win the odd rifle round to keep their lead. The final round was night-and-day, with G2's coordinated defensive ideas countering EDG's individual attempts to end the decider map 13-11. “Trace would super cool,” leaf said regarding teams he would like to play next. “I think DRX would be cool, it would be fun to have that kind of ‘rematch'.” While G2 have earned a week break, EDward Gaming will next play on August 11. The group D decider match will give EDG a second opportunity at playoffs and decided the final team to reach the top eight."

You can tell they're pretty comfortable on the map. I just have to look back at the VOD and see what happened.\" On the third map, Ascent, you guys have been running with Deadlock and had been undefeated until today. Did you notice anything wrong apart from not executing the game plan? Do you feel like they anti-stratted you pretty well on defense, or was something wrong with the team's execution?\" Itopata: \"I think we didn't execute the composition properly, but they also did some good anti-stratting on us. They were keeping control of certain areas of the map that we usually never get contested on, and I think that threw us off a little bit.\" For the next match, it'll be against either Talon once more or Vitality. Which one would you rather face, something new or a team you've already been against? Mazino: \"It doesn't matter who I have to face. The important thing is to win, and I personally don't care who we have to play.\""

    "cleaned_content": "Note: This article is a text port of our live interview with C0M. The video interview can be found here . Your match was against one of the biggest unknowns of the tournament, Trace Esports. Have you had any prior experience playing against Trace, such as practicing against them during Shanghai? \"No, never played against Trace before. I think going into this match overall, we looked at what they were doing, and they were doing a lot of good stuff. And yeah, they played really well today. Honestly, you could just tell they were playing well.\" Did you have any other initial thoughts about going against Trace heading into today's matchup? \"Yeah, that's pretty much it. They weren't like other Chinese teams, I would say. They were a lot more slow and thought out in the way they were playing, whereas most other Chinese teams are very run it down, like W gaming, you know.\" Some teams have said already that Trace is very, very macro heavy. Do you think that kind of reflects in today's matchup? \"Yeah, they had very good macro. We sometimes gave away our full macro in a matter of like the first five seconds of the round, so it was a lot. We kind of need to look back at the VOD for sure. I think again against Talon, we didn't play too great and today, I'd say it's the same. So I guess it's just about finding our overall form again.\" LEV began the map veto by letting Bind stick through the veto. Whereas Trace pulled off somewhat of a clean sweep against Vitality on Bind to get to today's match, LEV had a bit of a rough first showing on the map, narrowly taking it 13-11 against Talon. How confident did the team feel against Trace's Bind initially? \"We were pretty confident going into it. To be honest, I felt like we had a lot of advantageous spots and they just, it felt like we just died randomly, honestly, whether it be from spam or whatever they were doing. I wasn't too sure. But I mean, that's how the cookie crumbles.\" What is it like playing against Trace's double sentinel Bind comp? Are you able to point out any particular weaknesses or strengths from just a cursory glance? \"I think it's good, but also I feel like we didn't stick to our game plan at all. Whenever we went into it, we kind of gave them all the space they needed to execute, and then on defense we kind of just stayed stagnant for the most part.\" Map two took you to Sunset. It's a map that you've had fairly good performances on throughout split 2. On the opposite side, Trace also lost the map to Vitality in their previous match. Would you say that Sunset was kind of a comfort pick for the team heading into today? \"I feel like our map pool overall is very good. Maybe we have to look at it a little bit more after this, but I think our map pool is good overall. Even if we went to the Grand Finals and we had two map ban disadvantage, we'd be fine. But I think it's just essentially figuring our map pool out. I think we know the general direction we want to go now, but I don't know, time will tell.\" On that note, were you kind of more prepared to play your own game, not just for Sunset, but through the series as a whole? \"Yeah, I think again, we didn't really follow our game plan that well and it became very individualistic. It's just about, I mean, we just have to go back to the drawing board on that.\" While you did eventually win on Sunset, a lot of it came to momentum. You had a 4k on a 4v5 retake on round seven off the back of your team's timeout, and LEV went on a hot streak of rounds after that. How important do you think getting that initial round from your performance was in getting the team spirit back on track? \"I think it was big because whenever people have individual pop off rounds, it kind of gets people back in the flow of the game. I'd say these last couple games, we were not fully in flow. People are here and there, kind of lackadaisical in some ways. But I think it's pretty normal, this game has that and it's just about working through that as a team and keep growing.\" On both sides, at one point it seemed as if something clicked to give LEV full steam ahead to set the tempo and win streaks of rounds. Especially on defense, what clicked for the team to gain such momentum? \"I think people just started giving all their ideas. As soon as we started flowing with our ideas and filling in gaps perfectly and doing everything that we can do to win the game ultimately, that's when our team becomes unbeatable. But I think whenever we're lacking ideas, then it becomes very 50/50.\" Moving on to Ascent now. Things, to put it mildly, definitely didn't go in your favor, especially in the first half. You took both timeouts by round 11 and at that point, you were down 10-2 before eventually falling at the half down 10-2. What did you discuss through both timeouts and even at halftime to try to get back on track? \"The first one was figuring out what we should do to counter what they were doing. The second one was just reassuring the game plan, which even for me, I probably didn't follow all the way to perfection. And yeah, we just didn't work the map as well as we wanted to in previous times. I think it was just reinforcing the game plan, trying to figure out what we could do and then try to win some rounds.\" Ascent eventually fell 13-5. Overall, what went wrong on the map as a whole? \"Every time we went for some sort of little execute, they were perfectly just holding their utility out for that. They would be holding a lot of utility and baiting out stuff perfectly. It was just overall good. They played well, I'm not going to take that away from them, but we definitely underperformed.\" Were there any specific players that you think were troubling or hard to play against today? \"I would say on map three, Kai, just because Kai had an Operator. Every time we tried to push him off, he just kept getting a pick. I think we ended that map with some crazy amount of first deaths on everyone, like 13 or 14 without a trade, which just cannot happen. So yeah, I would say Kai.\" This is also your first match against a Chinese team this year, whereas previously you did win against EDG in Champions 2023. A lot of time has passed since then. Since then, how much do you think the region has caught up in the year since? \"I just think they have a lot more diversity in their region. I think especially this year, there are slower teams that know how to default out the map and just know exactly what they need to do to win the rounds. They know their win conditions, which is respectable. They're progressing. I said even before this tournament, I think China will be very good. I think all regions are pretty even right now. And yeah, I just think they played really well.\" Your chances aren't over yet. You and aspas still have the chance to become two-time world champions in the lower bracket, and it starts by getting to go against one of Vitality or Talon. Which of the two are you more excited to go against? \"Either one. I think our team is pissed off. We want to put our best foot forward and not go out of Champions like a former version of ourselves. So yeah, either one we play, I'm excited to play. It doesn't matter who, just I'm down to play.\" Lastly, just to forget the loss for a minute, you were able to have your family here to watch you play in Seoul. Putting the loss aside, how does it feel to play Champions with their support? \"It feels really good. I mean, they haven't been able to go to a lot of the VCT Americas games, so it's definitely nice to see them here and watch me compete. But something I want more than anything is just to have them see me lift a trophy. If I'm not able to do that at this tournament, then honestly, I consider it a failure.\""

Trace picked Bind and Leviatán picked Sunset, leaving Ascent as the decider. Bind began with Trace running their double Sentinel composition with Deadlock, while Leviatán stuck to their Gekko variation of the standard Bind comp with Viper, Skye, Raze, and Brimstone. Starting on attack, Trace won the first pistol round to threaten a lead until Leviatán played meticulously to prevent spike plants. The pistol win and smart post-plant utility were enough for Trace to trade rounds evenly with Leviatán as they entered the half up 7-5. heybay dodges a grenade and outsmarts Leviatán. Trace were up 7-5 at the half, and a classic 3K from Kai confirmed their second pistol round win. It was clear that Leviatán were struggling with planting the spike on time due to the delay ability from the two Sentinels on Trace. Heybay had a great map, with plenty of his utility singlehandedly winning them important rounds. Heybay wins the round for Trace Esports with the Deadlock ultimate. Leviatán started to mount a comeback as soon as Trace won 11 rounds, but a fumbled post-plant on B site led to a half-second defuse from LuoK1ng . The next round was a confident win from Trace as they upset the champions of Americas by taking Bind 13-10. The series moved to Sunset, with Leviatán needing to win on their map pick to stay alive. aspas moved back to Neon while FengF stayed on Raze. Heybay moved to Breach but got three to win Trace their attack side pistol round. The patience and post-plant protocol from Trace shone as they built a 5-1 lead, but Leviatán adapted quickly. A 5-1 lead for Trace disappeared as aspas and C0M helped Leviatán win six rounds in a row to end the half up 7-5. Leviatán tried to push aggressively into spawn to win their first pistol round of the series, but it didn't work. Trace had an opportunity to halt the momentum that Leviatán built, but aspas' Neon and a tex clutch closed out the map 13-9. Tex clutches to help secure Sunset for Leviatán. For Ascent, Leviatán went with the Deadlock and Cypher double Sentinel, while Trace went with the default Ascent comp with Killjoy. Leviatán won their first pistol round but immediately lost their anti-eco round. With Kai moving from Cypher to Jett, Trace got the Operator in his hands and started to pull away from Leviatán. For the first time in the series, a team was up significantly at the half, and it was the Chinese third seed up 10-2 over the Americas victors. Kai and FengF roll over Leviatán to end the half up 10-2. Leviatán won their second pistol to provide the slightest amount of hope of a comeback, but the team couldn't convert their bonus and Kai buying the Operator again signaled the end of the series. The map ended 13-5, as Trace completed their second upset in a row to secure the first playoff slot in Group C. Leviatán will face the victor of TALON and Team Vitality for their final chance to qualify for the playoff stage of Champions 2024."

    "cleaned_content": "Note: This article is a text port of our live interview with Chronicle. The video interview can be found here . The first question I'd like to ask is regarding the time between your last match and today. In the four days that you've had downtime since your opening match against BLG, what are some of the things that the team has been working on? \"To be fair, we were just preparing for this match of course and trying to get used more with our Abyss comp. We were also trying to adapt to what they will probably try to ban against us and what they'll pick against us in terms of maps. At the end, it didn't go well because I think at some point they kind of outplayed us with this one and also they slightly changed their gameplay on both maps which we played today, so we also got outplayed in that.\" Today's matchup against DRX is the fourth time you've faced each other in a Champions match. With a current 3-1 record over DRX in Champions. Did you have any thoughts on going against them once more? \"To be honest, no thoughts. I actually have nothing to say.\" By going against DRX, you also played against one of the two home crowd teams in the tournament. How did it feel playing on the stage against the crowd favorite? \"To be fair, I didn't feel it was really on their side. It was just fine, like nothing really special. It wasn't like the Brazilian crowd at LOCK//IN, I will say, in terms of how passionate and loud they were. I think they kind of cheered for both teams.\" Abyss was DRX's pick and is completely new territory for FNATIC heading into today. Leading up to this point, how did the team approach Abyss from the time it launched until now? \"I think our Abyss exactly is just more about rotations and trying to be always on the strong side when they're executing. At some point we did it well, but we struggled with actually doing what we need to do after that. We had a lot of times three or more people on sites and we were not really ready to counter them, and that was our problem. But I think it's something about related to the fact that we played Abyss only once and it might be good, might be great, or might be super bad. Today it wasn't great obviously, we lost, but I think it's a good lesson for us and I think we will come back better with Abyss or maybe some other maps in the next match.\" Did you feel as though it had the potential to be a strong map for the team? \"I think it's a strong map for us. DRX were playing Abyss good on Pacific and they also played well against KRU in their first match at Champions. I think their Abyss is very good and we showed the great potential to actually win against them since it was very close. We won some good clutches for the score and yeah, I think it has potential and we just need to discover some new stuff and be ready again.\" This leads us to FNATIC's Abyss comp. How did the team establish hiro playing Viper on the map, with him not having played the agent once on FNATIC until now? \"He was playing Viper in scrims and obviously on officials, he didn't show it until this point. But we felt that it's better to put me on Sova to help people with utility and let hiro be an anchor since he had some experience from being a sentinel. So yeah, it was kind of this point of making him play Viper and me on Sova.\" On Abyss itself, it wasn't the smoothest experience for FNATIC. You took three out of the four opening rounds, however DRX started to get themselves onto a hot start and ultimately took a 7-5 lead with six in a row for DRX. What went wrong on your attacking side? \" I think it was more about that we actually didn't really use our utility properly against them. It was mostly like that I was droning or reconning and we weren't really trying to play out of it and we were playing one by one. Also, it's just a disaster at this point because they have an Operator. What's better for an Operator than when the guys are kind of trolling? Obviously, it's hard to play after that and it's just very tough. We were giving also some entries but I didn't feel it was because of these types of mistakes, but just overall. We knew that he's going to op, we knew they were going to op there and we just didn't adapt properly.\" Three of the seven rounds you lost were lost to time, with another two being lost on retakes. Why did the team seem to struggle with the bomb sites for much of the half? \"Yeah, I mean it was just literally the same. Again, me trying to drone, people weren't really trying to play out of it and even with my info, we weren't trying to execute. I think it was more like that we were scared. We kind of dropped the ball at this point but yeah, I mean I think it's the same reasons again. Five out of the six defensive rounds you won were off the back of retakes. What makes your defensive retakes so strong on Abyss? \"I think most of them were their mistakes in clutches. They played it not so great and overall I think we actually tried something new because we didn't really retake that way in our scrims, but it was a fun experience and we won most of them so it's a good achievement. I felt like we can just go deep into that more.\" Ultimately, DRX took Abyss 13-11. What did the team discuss after map one to try and recover heading into Lotus? \"I think it was just about resetting and not thinking about the previous map, and of course focusing on the next one. The Lotus pick was kind of unexpected since they were banning it a lot in their previous matches. Obviously, we tried to adapt on the fly and it didn't really go well if you look at the results, but we tried to do that.\" Did DRX opting to choose Chamber throw off the team's preparation at all? \"No, they already played Chamber. They already did all this stuff but they just decided to swap. They put Foxy9 on Chamber and Flashback was playing Viper. This change I think makes sense because I think Foxy9 can utilize Chamber slightly better than Flashback, not to blame someone, it just is how it is. Overall, we actually knew how to play against their Chamber, but on defense, we didn't realize it at first. On attack, we didn't have that much to actually do. I mean, we were punishing him for staying on C which they default stuff on C like with the Chamber but we just, I think after that, we didn't realize our advantages and overall we again didn't play really well together.\" Before today, FNATIC had a flawless record on Lotus throughout all of Split 2. Overall, what were some of the things that you think went wrong on the map as a whole? \"Again, it's just like there are some key moments. Again, we didn't expect Lotus to be played since they were mostly banning it and we didn't really try to prepare it for the match. It just like somewhat hard to adapt. Also, they were just playing good at some moments and we played very poorly. We didn't realize our advantages, we were not playing together, some utility was just lost. We were just losing our utility sometimes for nothing and that's the main reason why we lost this match.\" Alfajer said in the previous match's press conference that sometimes the team “communicates like a tier three team”. Did some of these communication struggles continue into today's match, and if so, to what extent did it play a role in today's loss? \"I think so, yeah. I mean, he didn't say it properly because I felt like he needed to explain it more thoroughly. Sometimes we are communicating like a tier three team and we are not doing the basic stuff. It's just actually insane. Like, we are communicating so well, we are taking almost every single advantage or situation properly and we are like unstoppable. Today it obviously was a tier three performance for us sadly. We will try to work on it. For me, I would say I tried to communicate as much as possible but in some moments I still had problems with adapting and trying to find a proper solution for our team how to win certain rounds. I think I need to work on that, of course, but overall I'm happy with how I called in the situation even if it was bad. That's how I look at it, but obviously I did a lot of mistakes too.\" What were your main takeaways from the series as a whole? \"I think we were clueless. That's the proper explanation for our match today.\""

    "cleaned_content": "DRX have taken first place in Valorant Champions ' Group A, securing a playoffs spot in a 2-0 victory over FNATIC . Today's match was a repeat of the first bout between FNATIC and DRX, held all the way back at the Champions 2021 , which was also a group winner's match. FNATIC took a 2-1 victory then to claim their playoffs spot. Today, DRX were the ones to take a victory, but they did so in clean fashion. DRX's victory never seemed sure, though, until the final stages of the match. Abyss started with a 4K from hiro that gave his team a small lead, but DRX quickly replied with six straight rounds that led them to a 7-5 halftime lead. The second half was defined by back-and-forth momentum between both teams and several retake wins from FNATIC. When they finally found a 10-9 lead, MaKo and Foxy9 nailed Sheriff headshots that took them to map point. Even then, FNATIC nearly got a ninja defuse and pushed it to overtime. At the last second, BuZz blindly hit a knife on a defusing Chronicle and got his team the 13-11 win on their own pick. Alfajer was key in keeping Abyss as close as it was for FNATIC in their first outing on the map. Of his eight multikills, five were in the second half, among which was a 4K in round 23. His trademark Killjoy also found two clutches in the second half. In that map, he claimed a 1.49 rating, 25 kills and 210 ADR. He was second only in first kills to BuZz, as the Korean accrued one more than Alfajer. Lotus was equally close until the second half of the game. DRX's keys to a slight 7-5 margin at halftime were two back-to-back clutches from BeYN and a 4K from BuZz to bookend their attack. He proceeded to lock down the entire map for DRX on defense, finding eight of his 11 kills in the second half via an ace and a 3K in consecutive rounds. BuZz's stats tell a story of domination on Lotus, which he finished with a +10 differential and 23 kills. He also added up eight opening kills, surpassing his own six on Abyss. Even in the face of loss, Alfajer stands out from the crowd. He was an even match for BuZz across the match, but stood head and shoulders above his entire team. Alfajer finished the match with a 1.4 rating, 45 kills, and 193 ADR. The next best FNATIC player, Derke , left with a 0.89 rating, 28 kills, and 117 ADR. Counting today's game, DRX and FNATIC only have four VCT encounters between them, one per Champions. All of their previous bouts were three-map high-stakes thrillers, and DRX's sole win in those three was one that enabled them to break free from their top six curse in 2022 and go on to finish third in that year's Champions , their best international placement to date. They finished third back then, but did so without a home soil buff. Now they are playing in their home state of South Korea, just outside of Seoul, where the team is based and where they play the VCT Pacific. Now that they are playing at home, with a solid group stage behind them, DRX may not be stoppable."

Despite being the overwhelming favorites to win Champions Seoul , Gen.G faced an unexpected loss in a Shanghai rematch against Team Heretics . Despite their defeat, Gen.G's players reflected on how today's loss came to be in their post-match press conference featuring members of the media. Gen.G had the lead on Lotus but then lost it in the latter part of the map. What do you think was the reason for the comeback by Heretics on Lotus? Munhckin: \"They had really good plans going into the second half in their of their macro. We had opportunities, but we couldn't capitalize on them. As the team lost rounds, whenever Gen.G was shown on camera the team often looked frustrated. Was this due to mental pressure, or were there other issues affecting your gameplay? Munchkin: \"I think it's a little of both. I agree that our mental game wasn't the best today, but other aspects such as the smoke machine made it hard to breathe and see the monitor clearly. It got better in the third map, but overall, it was challenging.\" Who do you think will advance to face you in the next match out of FPX and Sentinels, and how do you plan to prepare? solo: \"I genuinely don't know. It could be a coin flip between the two, they both have a chance. It doesn't really matter who we play next, because whoever who our opponent is, we'll just prep and play our best game.\" Everyone was excited to see your interpretation of Abyss. How do you evaluate your preparation and performance on the map, and how well do you think Team Heretics reacted to your tactics?\" solo: \"I'd say we're about 70-80% satisfied with our overall performance with our macro and executions on the map. There were a lot of mistakes, but they did play their best game when it came to executing. Heretics were making a lot of mistakes as well. As for Team Heretics, they didn't have any VODs for our Abyss, but I think they did pretty well.\""

In a tense match deciding the first team to make it to playoffs in Champions Seoul , Team Heretics took an unexpected victory with a tight 2-1 victory over tournament favorites Gen.G . Following their win, Team Heretics took the stage in a post-match press conference to open up on some key takeaways from today's matchup. This was your first time facing off against Gen.G and in the teaser it was mentioned that you really wanted to play against them as they were the current best. How was the experience overall and did Gen.G live up to your expectations? MiniBoo: \"This was probably the hardest game I've ever played in my career. It was really hard; after the game my head was hurting. They played really well and I think we played really well too, but this time we were better. They lived up to my expectations. It was a really fun game to play and I hope it was a fun game to watch.\" Seeing as how last time Gen.G denied you guys from a trophy, what does it mean for the team to beat them this time in Champions? benjyfishy: \"We don't have any hatred towards Gen.G. I think it's a lot more like love, as you guys probably know. It feels really good to get revenge over them from Grand Finals. I still think they're going to make Playoffs and do really well because they're a great team. For me, it doesn't mean anything specific because we beat Gen.G, it's more about the fact that we've improved a lot since Shanghai and even from the start of the tournament.\" The last time you faced Gen.G on Lotus, it was a 13-4 loss at Masters Shanghai during Grand Finals that acted as their turning point for winning the series. But this time it was a huge comeback for you guys and turned the series around. Other than the role swaps from MiniBoo coming back in over paTiTek, what were some of the big changes you guys made after looking back at that loss from Shanghai? neilzinho: \"I think it's mostly just in general what we've done. Like benjyfishy said, we've improved quite a lot in the couple of days we've been here. It's not just about the last map, but it goes down to good preparation and support for the team from Weber, our performance coach, and Nicholas. Without them, it wouldn't be possible. We've improved a lot, we did our homework and prepared really well. We've had ups and downs, but the most important thing is now we're coming back up.\" During the second map, it was a breaking point when you were down 9-11 and made the full comeback to win Lotus. During the decider, it was the same situation \"but the opposite way. Did you feel any pressure from the situation that it was maybe a 50-50? neilzinho: \"From a coach's point of view, no. I don't think the players had time to think about that when they were playing. We were only thinking about the round we were in. We had a couple of attack pauses left, so for me, it was pretty chill. The boys were also really chilled the whole way through. Six or seven months ago, we might have felt the pressure, but now the guys are very good at focusing on the present and living in the moment, just focusing on the round at hand.\" Gen.G earlier today mentioned that you changed your comp probably because you knew that with your previous picks on Bind, you wouldn't be able to win. What was the thought process behind making the new comp, and maybe you can make certain comments about how Gen.G adapted to your new comp? Boo: \"For the comp, we had a lot of officials played with the previous comp, so we knew they had good coaching and would prepare well. We decided to change our comp rather than just how we played it. We prepared it for an average amount of time, and it can definitely be improved. As for how Gen.G countered it, I think they didn't counter it very well. On our attack, we had some lucky rounds and clutches, but our good utility and trading helped us win. On defense, we misplayed a few times, but overall, we adapted well to their playstyle, which hasn't changed much.\""

The first question I'd like to ask is regarding the downtime you've had since your opening match. Your victory against FPX was a little muddy, to put it lightly. With five days of off time ever since your first match, what mistakes or lessons from the FPX match did you try to improve on in practice in the days following the match? \"I think a lot of it was just the fundamentals, like basic stuff, peeking together, communication. I think all of those things are easy to do but hard to master. The point that we were at our best in those things was in Shanghai. I think it dropped a little bit towards the end of Stage 2 playoffs, and that's why we were doing badly. We've just been building it up over time. The break we had between Stage 2 and Champions starting made us improve a lot, and it was just because our fundamentals have gotten a lot better. I think that's also why we won today.\" Today was your rematch against Gen.G. You last played them in the Shanghai finals and fell 2-3. What initial thoughts did you have going against them once again, this time with Champions playoffs on the line? \"I knew it was going to be a very hard game because they are a very good team, but I was feeling really confident. I could feel the improvement we had between this game and the FPX game. I could feel us improving in scrims, practice, and our mentality, which I was really happy about. That's the reason I was feeling super confident. You can't control if you win or lose a game; you can just control what you do inside the game. I think we did the best we could, and that's why we won.\" By playing today's matchup, you went against the home team who are also overarching favorites to win the event as a whole. How did it feel on the stage playing against the overwhelming crowd favorite? \"I never really get nervous anymore. The pressure is always higher when the crowd isn't on your side, but we've done this so many times now. In Shanghai, we played against all Chinese teams. We know what it feels like to have the crowd against us, but I actually feel like the crowd here was also kind of supporting us, which I was happy about. We had some cheers, so I was happy. I think some Gen.G fans are also fans of us, which is nice. It must be kind of hard for them seeing us play against each other if they are fans of both, but it felt good. The crowd was loud, which is what I love. I like being able to hear the crowd. If I do something sick, hearing the crowd scream through the mics is a really good feeling. I don't really care if it's against us or with us; I just like having a loud crowd.\" Today's match marked Gen.G's debut on Abyss and was your map pick. In contrast, Heretics is one of the few teams to have played Abyss three times ever since its addition to the map pool. How is playing or practicing Abyss different in Asia compared to what you typically see in Europe, and how, if in any way, do these differences reflect in your approach to the map? \"The big thing is just the Asian play style. Playing and scrimming teams here is different than scrimming teams in EMEA. Some teams in Europe play the same as APAC teams. If I had to name some, probably CGN and Acend play like an APAC team. They have crazier play styles and comps, so I think it's just getting used to different comps. We've played against Yoru in scrims before, and it prepared us well for this game against Gen.G. Before coming to APAC, we had never scrimmed against Yoru on Abyss, so yeah, people like Yoru here.\" Even after gathering some great momentum in the second half of map one after a 1v1 by Boo, Abyss ultimately fell out of your hands. Overall, towards the end of the map, what do you think were some of the things that started to go wrong? \"It is hard playing against a team that you have no info on. They had info about how we played, but we didn't have info about how they played. I think we lacked some balls and confidence. We were playing a bit scared. If we played with more confidence, we probably would have won map one. We started gaining confidence over the next two maps, and that was a big help. You've got to have confidence against a team like this because if you play scared, they are just going to beat you.\" Did anything about Gen.G's comp or the way they work around and play Abyss stand out to you? \"They are just crazy. They are an APAC team, a coordinated APAC team. They take one versus ones and do crazy stuff like swinging through smokes. They are a lot more coordinated, swinging through smokes together with util sometimes. They are very coordinated, which makes it so hard to play against them. They do unpredictable stuff but do it well and together. It's hard to counter sometimes. We found ways to counter it, but in general, if they do it well, you'll just die.\" Moving onto map two – even though Gen.G stole the anti-eco away from Heretics, you didn't let their advantage get out of hand despite being down 10-5. What changed on Heretics' attack approach to steal Lotus away from Gen.G? \"First of all, it is an attack-sided map. We knew that. Defense is difficult to play on Lotus. They also have a good attack. It came down to confidence. Part of the timeout at halftime was just saying we need more confidence. If you play scared, you're just going to lose. We played with a lot of confidence and played together. We had some clutches that went our way as well, and that always helps. We played a lot more together and with confidence, which we lacked on defense and also in Abyss.\" A massive curveball comp came for Heretics heading into Bind. You flipped the switch and swapped out Raze, Fade, and Brimstone for Yoru, Astra, and Skye. How was this agent combo decided on? \"We played similar comps in Kickoff with the same idea of a ton of flashes. We did it mainly for comfort picks. All of us are comfortable on the agents we play. We knew Gen.G would have anti-stratted us because we've played so many times with the same comp and style. It was getting very anti-strattable. We swapped it up, and we knew if we spent time changing the comp, they wouldn't know what to expect. They wouldn't have watched our Kickoff games from Stage 1 to figure out how we play this comp. We played it quite similar to then, with some changes. It was mainly just because we knew they would anti-strat us, and we weren't super comfortable with our old comp anymore.\" Off the back of your Lotus comeback, Heretics got off to an incredibly strong 8-4 lead. What do you think went right on your starting side on Bind in contrast to how Lotus began to get to such a commanding start? \"It felt good being in the lead. For me, I don't really think about the score too much. Momentum is a lot more important. I focus on each round at a time. I don't think about what's going to happen next round or worry about losing the game. If you focus on that, you'll lose to yourself. I focus on the present, and it's something I've been working on a lot. It obviously felt good having such a good attack side. It gave me confidence because I was also playing well. Going to defense, we just went with the same confidence.\" Even with Gen.G inching forward with a comeback of their own, you were able to keep your cool and stave off disaster. Did you have any real worries of a comeback on the second half of Bind as the scoreline got closer and closer? \"As we started losing rounds, I could feel the momentum slipping away, but I wasn't worrying too much because I knew if I was feeling good, we would win the game. I knew we were going to win the game.\" You went through a well-fought and incredibly close victory today. How does it feel to get revenge from your loss in Shanghai? \"I was really hoping to win grand finals, so it definitely felt good. I think also the fact that they were kind of like the favorites of Champions, and I mean they were the favorites to beat us as well. We were kind of underdogs. It kinda reminds me of when we first made the team, to every team we were just underdogs. It felt good being an underdog again after so long of being just a highly rated team. Obviously people still rate us, but they didn't rate us higher than Gen.G. To become underdogs and win again brings me back to early days of the team.\" FPX, Sentinels, and Gen.G remain in your group: three incredibly strong teams, but only one can qualify. Which one of the three do you think will make it, if you had to pick just one? \"If Gen.G don't qualify, that would be something crazy. I want to be honest. The thing is, it is a group of death, right? Everybody's really good, but I think Gen.G is still on another level. I'd be really surprised if Gen.G don't qualify, so yeah, I'd just have to go with Gen.G.\" Lastly, during map one, you seemed to be looking at your mom and brother on the stage as they did the halftime interview. How does it feel for you to be playing with the support of your family? How significant of a difference does it make to you, especially in the most important event of the year? \"Yeah, I mean, it's super important for me. One of my goals at the start of the year was, I had a little notes page on my phone, and one of them was to have my family and friends watch me at an international tournament. First of all, it was to qualify to an international event. So now it was to kind of let them watch me play. For Shanghai, I had two of my friends coming out, and now this time I've got my mom and my brother. So yeah, it feels really good. It's really nice to see them in the crowd. Being able to see them after games or before games, whatever, it's just a nice sort of break from how intense everything is in the VCT. It's a big relief. I'm too happy that they're here and not back home in England, so yeah.\""

    "cleaned_content": "MiniBoo on stage in the winner's match of Group B (Photo by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games) In a match to punch the first ticket to the Champions Seoul quarterfinals, Masters Shanghai runners-up Team Heretics defeated Masters Shanghai champions Gen.G 2-1. The sequel to Gen.G vs. Heretics did not disappoint, going the distance once more. The three-map series was played out on Abyss, Lotus, and Bind, with Abyss being Team Heretics's pick, Lotus being Gen.G's pick, and Bind being the decider. Gen.G won Abyss 13-11, Team Heretics won Lotus 13-11, and Team Heretics won the all-decisive Bind 13-10. After playing against and defeating Sentinels , the team who had beaten them in the Masters Madrid grand final, Gen.G went up against another familiar foe in Team Heretics. The biggest differences between Tuesday's match and the Shanghai grand final in June were the re-introduction of MiniBoo , and Abyss being added to the map pool. “Props to paTiTek , because he played extremely well in the [Shanghai] grand finals,” Gen.G's Munchkin said, speaking on the new-look Team Heretics after the match. “They were a strong team back then as well, but with MiniBoo rejoining their team and with them at their full strength, their agent pool is much wider, which lets them approach the game differently.” Map one was Gen.G's first time on Abyss. Valorant's newest map was one of Gen.G's frequent bans while playing in the Pacific region this year. They used a team comp identical to what they had frequently run on Breeze earlier this year. After a back-and-forth first half, Gen.G closed their attacking half ahead, 7-5. After the teams switched sides, the back-and-forth nature continued. Gen.G called both of their timeouts in the last five rounds of the map, wanting to secure the win and steal their opponent's map pick. Coaches solo and HSK appeared to go to the drawing board during these timeouts, grabbing three out of the last five rounds for a narrow 13-11 victory. On Jett, t3xture played below his usual standard, unable to find a single kill with the operator. He still had moments, seizing six multi-kill rounds, including an early four-kill round to seize the momentum. t3xture records a crucial post-plant 4K. Meteor was the standout on Abyss, claiming nine multi-kills, including a pair of four-kill rounds. He finished the map with a server-leading 28 kills on Yoru. After stealing Team Heretics's map pick away from them, Gen.G's map pick of Lotus was up next. In the grand final at Masters Shanghai, Lotus was the penultimate map to be played. Gen.G claimed it 13-4, the first of two blowout victories before crowning themselves the champions at Masters Shanghai. On Lotus, up 10-5 and three rounds away from closing the series for good, Gen.G lost their grip on the game, losing eight of the next nine rounds and eventually, their map pick. Lotus wasn't just closer than it was at Masters Shanghai, it was almost an entirely different map for Team Heretics. The European team's fantastic attacking half, highlighted by winning eight of the last nine rounds, was highlighted by them holding three operators in the map-winning round – a sign of their healthy economy. Gen.G had 15 first bloods in the map, but could not convert the 5v4s. They'd have just one successful retake out of ten attempts. After being down 10-5, Team Heretics came back and stole Gen.G's map pick. \"Fifteen? That's crazy,\" benjyfishy said in an interview with VLR after the match. \"If you're down 4v5 or 3v5 you've gotta have the confidence to go and do something that's gonna win you the round and against Gen.G, even if its a 5v5, if you let them do what they want they're probably just going to kill you,\" he said. \"You've gotta do something extra and I think that's what we were doing. We were making plays, doing stuff on post-plant, doing stuff like that. When we didn't do that we lost, so we kinda realized we needed to do more than what we realized we should do.\" That left the series to the decider map, Bind, the same map that FunPlus Phoenix had defeated Team Heretics on and a map that Gen.G had gone undefeated on this year. Team Heretics reinvented their team comp, which included three agents with flashes to assist with attack-side entries. They'd end their attack half up 8-4, much better than the four rounds they managed against FPX. Team Heretics's flash-heavy comp was effective on defense, too. Team Heretics could flash for information, and every swing was accompanied by a flash. As the Team Heretics wins started to pile up, Gen.G heads fell into Heretics crosshairs. Down 11-7, Gen.G looked to claw their way back, and their play after a timeout improved. They managed to bring it to 11-10, but Heretics put the map and series away with two dominant rounds. Perhaps the most uncharacteristic performance was that of Gen.G duelist t3xture, who finished 49-56 and with zero operator kills across all three maps. On Bind, he finished 8-18. Following the match, a member of the media asked Gen.G if there were any reasons for them appearing less motivated than usual, and in-game leader Munchkin appeared to point to an unexpected external factor: the smoke machines in the arena. “It did make it hard to breathe. It did get better in the third map, but it makes things foggy,” he said. “We also couldn't see the monitor clearly.” Gen.G's Meteor finished with a server-leading 76 kills, while benjyfishy led an all-rounded attack with 56 kills. “This was probably the hardest game I've ever played in my career,” MiniBoo said. Gesturing to his temple, he said “After the game, my head was hurting.” The loss is just Gen.G's second-ever loss this year in international play, with the first being their Masters Madrid loss to Sentinels. Having survived the ‘group of death' unscathed, Team Heretics claim the first of eight upper quarterfinal slots and await the results and ensuing draw, while Gen.G will play on Saturday against the winning team between Sentinels and FunPlus Phoenix."

After their victory, EDG took to members of the media in high spirits for their post-match press conference. This is S1Mon's first international event. How did you feel today and did you feel nervous? Did your teammates help encourage you before going to the stage? Do you have any expectations for the G2 match? S1Mon: \"I was a little bit nervous on map one. I wasn't nervous on map two, but I didn't get kills. Regarding expectations for G2, I don't have much to say about that. Smoggy took the MVP in today's matchup. What made your form so good today? Smoggy: \"I actually didn't play that well on scrims yesterday. That's why it makes me look good today, but maybe it's because I slept really early last night.\" EDG are looking to be in their top form as of right now. Whereas before EDG seemed to have lost their direction and playstyle as a team, the team have found your direction back to form. Could you describe your playstyle right now? ZmjjKK: \"I felt like there was good points in both periods. If you really wanna talk about the two coaches and their different style when they coach us, I feel like we all had good performances and good growth in the international tournaments. I wouldn't say there was a big change, and if we talk about our playstyle, maybe we're pushing a little bit harder than before. I think both of the ways we played is good, but I don't really want to talk about this topic right now. I just want to take this step by step and take our best in Champions and win every matchup we should win.\" What were your initial expectations against FUT heading into the match? Muggle: \"Our expectation was a 2-0. It was a little close on map two, but generally, our performance was to the level of our expectations.\""

    "url": "https://www.vlr.gg/384816/edg-begin-redemption-arc-against-fut",
    "cleaned_content": "The final day of opening matches at Champions 2024 concluded with EDward Gaming handily taking down FUT Esports in two maps. EDG came into Champions seeking redemption for a year full of results far below their own expectations and those of their fans. They took a steady step towards that redemption with this result. Multiple high profile wins at international events in 2023 raised the hype around a young superteam coming from a new region and the upside their future might hold. However, after a year of disappointing results, leading to dropping their IGL and losing multiple games in China to weaker teams, EDG became an afterthought in the race for the Champions trophy. Only 17.4% of VLR pickems chose EDG to even make it out of Group D. The first hurdle towards a triumphant return to grace was a consistent EMEA competitor in FUT. The Turkish squad had a slow start to the year but slowly rose to fight for EMEA's top seeds, heating up for a top-six placement at Shanghai. That hurdle was cleared as EDG cleaned up both Lotus and Bind while starting to look like the team that was pulling off big wins in 2023. On both maps, they favored double Controller and Initiator compositions which powered them to dominant 8-4 attacking halves. Aside from some individual heroics, FUT had no answer for the onslaught. Too little too late. Historically, Smoggy and CHICHOO had played majority Duelists and Sentinels respectively, but as the Controller duo, they won the day. Their combined +28 kill differential outshone even EDG's usual star, ZmjjKK . The duo also combined for twice as many clutches as the entirety of FUT. They took turns notching 4Ks in back-to-back rounds to push EDG's lead to 7-1 on Lotus to set the tone for the match. On the other side of the field, FUT's stars were held in check. After EDG jumped out to that 7-1 lead on Lotus, cNed tried to turn the tides, jumping out on defense with three straight opening picks. Unfortunately for the Turks, cNed only managed seven kills outside of opening duels all map, and very rarely did someone else step up in the midround to pick up the slack. Converting openings into victories was an even bigger challenge on Bind. A 15-8 opening kill record is typically correlated with a convincing win, but it took a second half comeback to tie the game at 10 all. Once EDG got their economy stabilized, they rose to the occasion to win the map and series. Even when FNATIC had popularized the half-armor meta, FUT were choosing to save for full armor almost every round possible. Favoring Sheriffs instead of Classics in the eco rounds and full armor in the full buy rounds gave them some of the highest eco rates of any team throughout 2023. The effects of the Outlaw on economic management has pushed the meta back towards them somewhat, but this game was a prime example of the differences that still exist between them and the meta. Despite being sent to far more eco rounds than EDG, FUT also had more full buys beyond 20,000 credits spent. EDG were more willing to accept half armor or mixed buys to potentially avoid an extra eco round or two each game. When Outlaws did not make an appearance, EDG's strategy found considerable value. EDG's victory secured regional parity during the opening rounds of the group stage. Every Americas team faced a Pacific team, every EMEA team faced a Chinese team, and each region sent two teams to the winners match and two teams to the losers match. FUT can still make a deep run in Champions, but they will have to get past Paper Rex , a team with the talent to run anyone over if they have a good day. It will take a significant bounce back if the Turks want to replicate their top-eight performance from last year's Champs. The winners match of Group D will pit EDG against the favorite from the group. G2 Esports was chosen by over 29,000 pickems to take the winners match while EDG made an appearance in just over 2,900. This puts EDG back in the position that originally endeared them to fans around the world: plucky underdogs."

    "cleaned_content": "Note: This article is a text port of our live interview with d4v41. The video interview can be found here . Paper Rex started their journey in Champions Seoul with a dominant 0-2 defeat against G2 Esports on the opening match of day four. VLR.gg had the opportunity to speak to Paper Rex's Khalish \" d4v41 \" Rusyaidee following their loss. I'd like to start off by asking about how the last few weeks have been for the team. Leading up to Champions, the team had an unfortunate finish to VCT Pacific, ending the season as the third seed. After the split ended, what were some of the things that the team has been working on to come back into form? \"I think we were trying to improve on our teamwork coming to this tournament. I think in Shanghai, we didn't really play well as a team. I think that's the path that we are going for right now.\" It's been pointed out before that ever since the addition of your new assistant coach bulb, the team has been putting more emphasis on coordinated team play rather than solely the signature W Gaming playstyle. Now that the team has had more downtime since the conclusion of VCT Pacific, how has making some of these adaptations played out for the team in practice? \"His role right now is just pointing out mistakes in-game, mostly individual mistakes. I think he's doing well in practice. I mean, today I guess I would say we weren't really playing our A game. G2 also played really well, so I guess it's not really showing up to the level that we play in practice. Hopefully by the next matches we do show how we play in practice.\" Today's match against G2 marks the third time you've gone against their core, with a 1-1 record to date between the two of you, most recently losing to them in Shanghai. Did you have any initial thoughts on the rematch before taking them on today? \"I think our goal was just to win against an NA team coming to this match. After seeing the bracket, we've been losing to NA teams couple of times, I believe. I think our goal is just to break our streak, I guess, and unfortunately it didn't go well for us. It was a bit of a new look for the team coming into Icebox. Previously, throughout the entire year, the team opted to pick KAY/O as the primary Initiator for the team, However, coming into the G2 matchup it was switched out for Sova. What led to the change? \"I think it was because recently, we struggled a lot against the Operator, which is why I think that's how we changed to Sova. I mean, today's game I would say was a little bit different because they a ran no Duelist comp, so I guess we weren't not synchronized enough to stop their retakes. We kind of knew their game plan and I guess we kind of crumbled in a few rounds. Leaf managed to flank us and even almost got an ace.\" It seemed to be a slow start for PRX's defense on Icebox, ending the half 4-8. What were some of the main concerns the team addressed before heading to your attack? \"I think we were very bad at dealing with their retakes, such as with the Gekko flashes. I think they combo it pretty well. I would say team-wise, I mean personally even myself, I think I haven't been hitting shots as well today, so I think that's probably on me.\" That translated over to your attack as well. On your attack side, it then seemed like PRX had a notably tough time fending off G2's retakes. What do you think went wrong on the team's postplants? I think with this specific comp, maybe when you're not hitting shots and having to deal with util such as Wingman and Harbor's Cove, I think it pretty much added more problems to our postplant. I think we weren't fast enough or not synchronized enough to stop the retakes. In hindsight, did not having KAY/O kind of hurt your Icebox postplants even more? \"Yeah, kind of. Could be, I mean, since they surprised us with this comp, maybe we should have swapped back. I mean, who knows, right?\" After map one, alecks made a comment to the main stream about there being a “game plan” that wasn't followed through by the team on Icebox. If you're able to, what about your initial game plan for Icebox went wrong as a whole? \"I think what he meant by that is probably that we should have tried their B site as well. There were a lot of rounds that we ended up going A, so I think what he meant was maybe we should have tried going B and see how it goes rather than hitting our head against the wall and trying to go A again and again.\" Unfortunately, a similar slow start theme seemed to continue even into Lotus. Both timeouts were taken by the end of the first half, only to be down 9-3. What issues did alecks discuss throughout both timeouts and the halftime to try and stop the bleeding? \"He pretty much talked about stopping their retakes. I think we all needed to be on the same page in terms of destroying their utility. That's pretty much what he mentioned, that we should be more vocal about it, who was going to destroy or try to shoot their stuff together. We weren't on the same page.\" The series ultimately ended 0-2. Looking back now, do you think G2 played differently from how the team initially anticipated, and if so, what changed from what PRX initially prepared? \"I don't think so. I think they played pretty much how we expected. So yeah, I think it's whether you can stop their game plan and their flanks, I guess. I mean they played quite different from other teams. I would say some teams from Asia don't really play like that very often. Today they played differently and I think they were being quite creative with their Harbor walls, such as to stop our Killjoy turret from supporting us. Props to them.\" What are some of your key takeaways from how the team played during the series as a whole? \"I don't know. I mean, maybe we should have been less readable, I would say. Maybe we should work more in terms of our tactics. I think we were quite obvious today, I think that's why especially on Lotus, they had stacks every time we hit the site. They always had an extra one or two people. Maybe for our coming matches we would try to be less readable, I think.\" You'll now have to face one of EDG or FUT in the lower bracket in the coming days. Which of the two are you expecting to go up against? \"I think it's hard to say. Both teams are very good teams, and EDG is looking good as well. FUT is also looking good in EMEA. I'm not too sure, I think it's a 50/50 game, but I think if I had to choose one, I think it probably would be EDG due to their new roster.\""

    "cleaned_content": "Day four of Champions Seoul kicked off with a 2-0 victory for Americas second seed G2 Esports in the opening match for Group D. Following the loss, Paper Rex coach alecks took the stand to members of the media in their post-match press conference regarding several collective mistakes and shortcomings throughout the match. The team looked scrappy on both maps in the series. What do you think were some of the points that you could improve on? What are some things you think you need to improve for your next series? alecks: \"I think on Icebox we just had a game plan but went away from it. Because of that, I think it made it more difficult for us. First off, G2, it's very rare we play a team like that. Maybe not rare, they have to play against you first. Sometimes we just if we play wrongly, and we can't hit our shots because we're in wrong positions. Basically, so just one Gekko flash hits all of us because they combine it very well. On Lotus, I think we just didn't play our comp well on attack. Our defense is okay. I think if we start on defense, we may have we gotten the lead instead.\" Online there have been quite a few posts which say that G2 were actually better suited for this matchup. Would you agree with this sentiment or do you think that this is wrong, and are there any comments that you guys would like to add onto it as well? alecks: \"I mean, they play really well. Regardless of playstyle, if you play really really well, I think you're going to have a very very good game regardless. I think we should have done better, but I don't think it came down to playstyle. We tried to do different things, and it still didn't work.\" How can you look at the state of Paper Rex in the time since Shanghai just a few months ago compared to now, in terms of form and the state of the team? f0rsakeN: \"I think we had so many problems during Shanghai. This time, I think we as a team, we feel as if we're together. Today, maybe it's just because it's our first match, but we had more mistakes. But I will say that in Shanghai, we didn't feel like we were family, but now I feel that we're more of a family now. I still believe I think we can have a lower bracket run.\""

    "cleaned_content": "G2 Esports have defeated Paper Rex 2-0 to open their Champions Seoul run. They advance to the Group D winner's match , where they will play against either FUT Esports or EDward Gaming for a spot in playoffs. Paper Rex descend to the lower bracket , where they will risk elimination against the losing team of the next series, EDward Gaming vs. FUT Esports . This match is the second time the teams had played against each other, the first being a 2-1 victory for G2 in the Masters Shanghai playoffs. It is also the G2 roster's debut at the marquee VCT tournament, as the core, previously on The Guard , have had attended one international event in the past. In the map selection, Ascent and Sunset were the first off the table. Paper Rex picked Icebox, followed by G2 choosing Lotus. Haven and Abyss were banned next, leaving Bind as the decider, which repeated the final two maps of their previous matchup. The veto slightly favored G2, as Paper Rex had only played, and lost, Icebox once since the beginning of Stage 2. The North American squad opened Icebox with a 3-1 lead, a Gekko bait play helping them win the fourth round by taking advantage of Paper Rex's quick rotations. A mid solo-play attempt from JonahP almost took the next round, but time was not in his favor. Paper Rex went on a small streak, holding the sites without breaking a sweat. G2 equalized at 4-4, as they matched, and took better advantage of, trade ultimates. Paper Rex win a combination something - mindfreak round Another round for the attackers prompted a timeout from Paper Rex, but they were unable to take another win, as G2 sealed the half 8-4. The Pacific team won the second pistol round, narrowing the gap. Their aggression was initially successful, with something and mindfreak winning a seventh round for their team, but their opponents adapted quickly. leaf gave his team the following eco round, and the defense continued to hold strong up until match point. Paper Rex then switched sites to B, scoring another win after dealing with G2's overextended defense. They returned to A the following round, a back-and-forth ending in a 2v2, but G2 closed out the map with a 13-8 scoreline. “We were expecting a tougher Paper Rex, and we got it,” JoshRT said about his opponents. alecks felt otherwise about his team's performance. “We had a gameplan, but we didn't really follow it,” the Paper Rex coach said. G2 Esports continued on defense to kick off Lotus, claiming the pistol round via a JonahP 4K. They earned a round streak to force a tactical pause and break their opponent's economy, only losing until round seven. G2 continued their dominance in the half, only dropping three rounds. JonahP was the highlight player during the defense, with 15 eliminations and a number of multikills pushing him to a 1.45 rating and 327 ACS. His performance helped G2 reach a 9-1 lead in their map pick. Paper Rex began their recovery by the final rounds of the first half, going to the break with a 9-3 scoreline. After halftime, they lost the pistol, but were able to take the follow up, starting to reduce their round deficit. This continued on for their defense, as G2 seemed unable to replicate their previous form to settle the series. Paper Rex had good ideas throughout the series, but G2 were better able to punish and capitalize on their advantages By 11-8, G2 called for their first pause ahead of an eco round. The additional support helped the team win the thrifty, which put them at match point. Paper Rex were able to win one more round, and gained the upper hand in round 22, but an icy triple kill put G2 on track to a 13-9 on Lotus. “We know [Icebox] is a good map for us,” valyn said after the series. “We just took it match by match and now it feels really [strong for us],” he added. “I dare teams to pick it.”"

    "cleaned_content": "Note: This article is a text port of our live interview with Gorilla. The video interview can be found here . Off the back of a 1-2 defeat to China's Trace Esports in the second match of Group C, VLR.gg had the opportunity to speak to Team Vitality 's Harry \" Gorilla \" Mepham regarding the defeat. For Vitality, even with a loss, today's match stands as a great learning experience for their future Champions matches. Champions is the first international event for Kicks and runneR. Additionally, trexx and ceNder, haven't been to an event ever since LOCK//IN. How did it feel for the team to play on the stage today for Vitality's Champions debut? Do you feel as though nerves were noticeable at all amongst the players? \"I think in the first map, it was definitely down to a lot of nerves. I'd say before we've never been a strong first map team, but I think that the nerves definitely did take over a bit in terms of how we were communicating. I think it was good to get it out the way and have a good mental reset after map one, which happened, but I think nerves played a part today.\" Ascent came as a strong map for both you and Trace. Coming into the map, what were some of the preparations in place for the way Trace plays Ascent? \"Mainly we were putting a heavy focus on Kai. He has a history to just walk up and contact in and buy the Operator on attack and defense. We noticed that he was definitely a win condition for them, so we put heavy prep into trying to play positions where we would minimize his value. It was mainly on focusing on where he plays and their main reactions to our stuff.\" A similar theme to the beginning of Ascent continued heading into your attacking half, where Trace found themselves taking many of the opening rounds, eventually finding their way up 11-6. However, you managed to help take what seemed like finished business for Trace into overtime. How did Vitality rally back from being down at a five-round deficit from round 18 onwards? \"It's the good old saying, when when you think it's over, it's never over against us. NaVi learned that the hard way. Heretics did as well when they were on Icebox when we were down 3-11 down. BBL learned it as well pretty quickly, so when you think that you have us down and out, you can never you can never count us count us out of coming back. We're very good at that.\" Vitality unfortunately ended up losing in overtime. Despite the loss, what were some of the main errors encountered on Ascent that you looked to fix before going into Sunset? \"Sunset is a very comfortable map for us, we're very good at it. So I think it was just a 'Okay guys, that's fine, they they played incredibly well on Ascent.' Honestly, I said it in the press conference, Trace has some of the best Ascent attack macro that I've seen. Resetting for Sunset, we know it's a weaker map for them, it's a stronger map for us, it should be fairly straightforward, and it was.\" Sunset looked firmly in your hands, as shown with a dominant end to the map 13-7. Do you feel as though the series could've swayed greatly in your favor as map two ended with a much more confident look for Vitality in comparison to Ascent? \"Oh yeah, one hundred percent. For map three, it kind of was as well. It was a 5-1 start at first.\" Trace entered Bind with a double Sentinel comp, choosing to play Deadlock over an agent like Viper. Initially, upon a first glance, do you think the change helped or hurt your chances at taking Bind? \"I think for the most part it did. It made their attack very strong, we used to run the Deadlock quite a lot on Bind, so we kind of knew what they could do with it and how they were going to. But I think it's just down to us pace-changing on attack when we didn't need to. We knew that against Deadlock, you play slow, default to break the traps, and then we really just didn't have an answer for them executing on us on defense. I think for the most part, if they catch us on a different day, we definitely take that map. Not having a Viper on Bind hurts teams a lot more than teams that have it.\" The first half of Bind ended dead even at 6-6. From being up 6-1 to tying at the half, what did you discuss before heading into defense? \"We discussed some of the prep because we hard prepped them. Bind was a map that we were initially going to pick, but we weren't entirely sold on if they'd run the same comp because they've changed agents every every time they played Bind. We decided to leave it for third map, so we discussed the prep and what they can do on their attack, the weaknesses of running the Deadlock and Cypher compared to more traditional comps; we were just basically not trying to predict what they'll do but put ourselves in positions to capitalize on their attack macro.\" You managed to take the second pistol, however your subsequent anti-eco resulted in a thrifty that led to Trace's momentum seemingly spiraling out of control. What mistakes caused things to start going wrong after round 13? \"I think we took a lot of solo fights against them. The only thing they have to initiate is the Skye dog. The flashes don't really do anything on Skye, so the only thing to really have impact on is the Skye dog. Against that, they just followed behind it; we basically just gave them too much. Viper would die in Lamps or we would give up Lamps and give them it for free, or someone would die in Hookah alone. I think we didn't adapt well enough on defense in terms of putting ourselves in positions to be anti-exec every round. We kind of just expected them to play a slower, more thought out round like they had done on the previous two maps. Do you think the aforementioned nerve issues made this problem worse? \"Yeah. I think it definitely plays in. I think every game, people are nervous. It's a competition, right? They're not underdogs at all here, I don't think anyone should be considered underdogs at Champions, but there people are predicting them to lose.\" Was there a moment where you realized that Trace's momentum seemed unstoppable? \"It was after the anti-eco. They've basically just been playing fast rounds, and then after the anti-eco, it's every map. If you lose the anti-eco after winning pistol, your your economy is awful while the other team's economy is amazing from that. Then by the time you get a buy, they get ultimates because they plan it out, and it just spirals out from there. It's really hard to come back from it.\" How do you view today's loss and what are some of your main takeaways from the series as a whole? \"I think it was a really good experience for everyone, myself included, like where I can improve on my timeouts. It was some well-needed experience. You need to get whooped every once in a while, and we had it here on that last map. But you know, I think even though we lost the series, we showed some really good rounds. We showed some really good team play together, but we just have to be better next time.\" To close off, with your loss today, you're set to go against Talon Esports in the coming days. Do you have any initial thoughts on the matchup? \"They play a style that again, we're not too used to. It's going to be a challenge for us, and we need to prepare well.\""

    "cleaned_content": "The second match of Group C saw a shocking 2-1 victory for Trace Esports over EMEA's Team Vitality . After their defeat, the team spoke at their post-match press conference regarding a few moments of reflection over the game. After today's loss, how is the team going forward for the tournament? What makes you guys reset after these scenarios and what do you think was one of the things that triggered the loss? Sayf: \"First of all, I don't think it's an upset. Obviously, like for a region you don't know much about, it's obvious they have good players and good teams, and people always play the assume game and they assume that someone is worse than someone else, which is not true. I think Trace Esports is a really good team from their region and obviously, we still have a long way in terms of what experience we have on the international stage, which we don't have. We as a team are still very new to all of this. I just want to start off by saying that first of all it's not an upset, I just think that they're a pretty good team. And second of all, how to reset between maps, I mean, it's the thing we've been working on for a long time and it's an approach we've had for a long time which is we don't really mind losing the first map, we've lost the first map a lot of times before and between sides, we try to keep the energy up and just go round by round. We don't really think much in-depth of what's happening, we try to think of what's happening then and now. Obviously today for us it didn't work out, but that doesn't mean it won't work out in the future.\" What are your takeaways from observing Trace Esports and what are some of their biggest strengths that you've seen from your points of view? How much of an obstacle were they to you guys throughout the entirety of this series? Gorilla: \"I think they played some of the best Ascent attack macro that we've played against. I think the only team that did it similar or played on a similar level was FUT when we played them back in Stage 1. So I think their Ascent attack macro is exceptional, it's definitely better than almost every team in Europe. On Bind, obviously, they just ran us, so I don't think there's much that we can say about that. As Sayf said, I think they're a really good team. Like at the end of the day, I don't really see a world where upsets happen at Champions, everyone deserves to be here. In prep they looked pretty solid so we knew that it wasn't just going to be a walk in the park.\" A lot of teams have been swaying away from Viper and we saw Viper come out again on Bind today. After the loss, how viable do you think she is in the current meta and if not, do you think there are better alternatives? runneR: \"From what I experienced, she's still viable. She can still be played easily on a lot of maps. I think she's really good, it's like you can't really play without her. The nerfs, sure, they hurt a lot, but you know back then I wasn't a Viper player so it didn't hurt me as much because I wouldn't really know. But now, looking at the new Viper after the nerfs, it's hard, but I think it's still viable and is still being played on a lot of maps.\""

    "cleaned_content": "The second match of the day was a third straight EMEA vs. China duel in the opening rounds of Champions 2024. After FunPlus Phoenix and Bilibili Gaming fell to Team Heretics and FNATIC , Trace Esports was looking to secure China's first win, up against Team Vitality . A back and forth battle led to a massive upset that knocked out over 95% of pickems as Trace finally got China their first win of the event. What an international debut. Trace were happy to be able to select Ascent, a map on which they were undefeated all year long. With their comfort pick in hand, they put the pressure on Vitality early. Kai found openings in Vitality's defense round after round to help Trace out to a 6-1 lead. Even once Vitality started to get rounds on the board, it didn't look clean. Sayf was stuck in a rut, and it took a round-eight clutch to start to snap him out of it. Even after losing a few rounds, Trace kept Vitality's economy on the brink. Their next round win immediately put Vitality down to an eco to give Trace a big chance to pull away with a 9-3 attacking half. Vitality did their best to make the map difficult to convert. Winning the round 11 eco round allowed them to salvage five rounds in the half. Even after losing the second pistol to a FengF clutch, they kept hanging in the map. The proactivity fell heavily in Trace's favor, even on defense. Tiles crunches found kills in multiple rounds, but Vitality adapted to the pressure well. Trace's site anchors were unable to hold firm against Vitality's measured site executes. Slowly but surely, Vitality clawed their way back to force overtime, winning six of the final seven rounds. After letting regulation slip through their fingers, Trace recovered their momentum in overtime. Their 15-13 victory was fueled by a great team effort across the board. A +6 advantage in first bloods and +15 advantage in kills was finally converted into a win. Even though Trace are newcomers to the international stage, Vitality pointed out that they are still trying to learn as well. “We still have a long way [to go] in terms of experience we have on the international stage,” Sayf said after the match. “I think they've played some of the best attack macro on Ascent that we've seen,” Vitality's head coach Gorilla noted. He compared Trace's excellence to Vitality's beatdown at the hands of FUT on Ascent during the regular season. Vitality picked their most played and won map, Sunset, but that also happened to be a similar story for Trace. Both teams had been tested thoroughly on the map heading into Champions. Keeping the pattern from Ascent, Trace won the pistol and looked like they were going to pull away with a big lead again. This time however, Vitality stabilized earlier. An eco win in round 5 turned the tides, and Vitality never looked back. My classic doesn't do that. Vitality mounted a stalwart defense towards the B site. Despite clearing runneR 's Cypher trips every round, Trace could not figure out how to take and hold the site. Their repeated attempts to challenge that side of the map cost them an 8-4 disadvantage at the half. Finally, Vitality won a pistol with a shock dart double kill from trexx , and they ran away with the second half. Unlike Trace, they had no trouble attacking the B site and steamrolled it repeatedly. Trace didn't go down without a few heroics. Biank found a nasty 1v3 clutch to try to ignite the comeback. Unfortunately, it only inspired incredibly overambitious individual play, and Trace threw away the following anti-eco to lose the map 13-7. Always a threat. After being Vitality's sole shining light on Ascent, trexx was even better on Sunset. His 24-8 statline was built on eight multikills that stifled Trace at every turn. Unlike Sunset, both teams came into Champs with questionable records on Bind. Both had a 33% win rate, and Trace were trying to rebound from a five-map losing streak. Most teams don't run a sentinel on Bind, but Trace went for both Cypher and Deadlock. Vitality knew how to shift gears against Trace's unconventional composition. Starting on the attack, they patiently waited out Trace's limited utility and understood how to diligently clear out the trips without rushing into them. They slowly marched out to a 5-1 lead. Trace looked to apply early-round pressure to punish Vitality's default spreads. Trap plays being set up B Long started to find value and opening picks. In the end, winning gunfights allowed Trace to pull back a 6-6 half. With two Sentinels, Trace lacked the utility to play an extensive give-and-go around the map. Instead, they leaned into the strengths of their composition, quickly executing onto a site and then using their Sentinels to hold. Vitality had absolutely no answer, and the map spiraled out of their control. “On Bind I think they just ran at us,” Gorilla said after the match. Across all three maps LuoK1ng was a standout performer, putting up 64 kills to 44 deaths. On the other side, trexx tried to hold on with a +22 kill differential, but he got far more sporadic help from the rest of his team. Trace moved into the winners match of group C to face LEV for a spot in the playoffs. Vitality were dropped to the losers match where they will have to get past Talon to stay alive. Trace offered their expectations for their upcoming match. “We [just] want to learn from the experience against Leviatán,” Luok1ng remarked. Trace's international debut may end up being more than just a learning experience at this rate. Banner image by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games"

    "cleaned_content": "Note: This article is a text port of our live interview with FrosT. The video interview can be found here . LEVIATÁN subverted doubts of an upset with a 2-0 victory over APAC's bottom seed TALON in Group C's first match. Following the match, VLR.gg had the opportunity to speak to Talon's Hector \" FrosT \" Rosario regarding the defeat. For FrosT, today's match had plenty of reflections, both good and bad. You've had just about three weeks of downtime ever since the end of your run in VCT Pacific. While the team's results following the Team Secret match didn't look phenomenal, what, if anything has changed regarding primmie's role in the team, and what have you since been able to implement as you headed into the match today? \"In playoffs, we were even picking maps that we're not supposed to or ones we wouldn't normally simply because for him we picked his comfort maps. DRX picked Ascent on us the last time we did that because simply put, we just wanted to put him in the most comfortable spot. Since technically playoffs didn't matter for us we had already qualified at that point we were simply just trying to do the best we could to try to let him play agents and compositions that he was comfortable with. Now, I basically have him on anything and everything since he's basically fully integrated into what we want to do you know. The largest change is we're no longer stuck with picking specific comps or maps, and now we can just do whatever we feel like we need to do.\" Heading into the match itself, and retaining the theme of comfortability; today was the team's Champions debut. Even with this being the first international event for Governor and primmie, were there any first-match jitters or nerves that you noticed amongst the players? \"One hundred percent. I have no problem saying it, but I think largely the biggest reason we didn't beat Leviatán is simply because we were just too nervous. We were too nervous and we kept making mistakes, we're forgetting plays, you know? That's just how it is.\" Talon entered Bind with a bit of a shocking comp. You opted to completely change every player's agents. To what degree did you deliberate on the composition over the last few weeks, and what led to some of the picks, most notably putting Governor on a new Neon map? \"I think for us what's interesting is that it seems like people get shocked about these comps, but if I think if you've watched us all year, we've consistently done this. Most of these guys can play every agent, so I have carte blanche basically on what ideas we want to run. We certainly found a lot of things we can exploit and we thought that we would have been able to do that and execute on that much better than we did. That comp seems unusual to people but there's a bunch of reasons why we felt like it was both the right thing to do against them. I think it would have given us the edge of the matchup. It didn't work out, and it is what it is.\" Judging by the fact that Bind was your pick, how did practicing this comp play out for Talon to make you confident in choosing it as the first map? \"Frankly we were just destroying everybody, but again, you know it it just is what it is. Some of these guys are very young, and as you mentioned it's their first time. It's sort of the growing pains that happen with people experiencing something for the first time, they don't always get it right. But if they stick with it long enough, obviously with the more experience comes more comfort and being able to play in these moments. I honestly think that we were just not as good as we should have been in particular moments and those swing rounds could just carry.\" Even after a bit of a slow start on Bind, falling early 0-4 and down 7-5 by the end of your attack, what did you discuss during halftime and onwards to keep the team's spirit up? \"In the pregame, I basically told them that the team that is often the most calm wins predominantly. Especially because as the stakes get bigger, and the tournament goes deeper, the game matters more to everyone else. If you can keep your head about you and you can do the things you're supposed to do, you take advantage of your advantages, you normally will win those. I kept trying to tell them like, 'Guys relax. You felt them now, they had a big lead, they threw it away, you're good, it's still winnable.' I wasn't really coaching, we pretty much knew what we were going to do on the other side. You talk about that 0-4, that should have been 0-4 for them, but it's unlucky. If we chain the rest of it that half could have gone the other way.\" What issues from Bind did you make known to the team to try and fix before heading into Ascent, especially seeing that you were initially up 11-9 on map one? \"The same issues that happened on Bind happened on Ascent. The truth is, it just comes down to being comfortable in these moments and dealing with the pressure, remembering the things you're supposed to be doing, and communicating effectively. Often times, those breakdowns happen when you're not ready. After we lost Bind, I basically said, 'Okay, we probably threw threw so many rounds away and still had a chance to win.\" I felt like we should be confident enough going into the second map, so I basically just tried to tell them that it was fine and to just through the second map, we'll win on Sunset and it'll be no problem. But ultimately, the same issues happened, it's just unlucky. On Ascent, you made the choice to return to the Nine Lives comp that had only been shown off twice throughout Split 2. Previously, you lost 6-13 to ZETA and narrowly won 13-11 to DRX with this comp, but you brought it back today for the LEV match. What made you bring it back and, in theory, what makes it good in your mind? \"Without getting too into it, there are specific advantages that comp has against what we saw. It was just kind of unlucky because on Ascent, I don't even think we gave ourselves a chance to win. The communication breakdowns, the mistakes with our util, it was just a mess. It was actually a miracle that at one point, it was like 7-9. We won four rounds in a row on defense and we basically thought that we can just control the whole thing, but then it's just mistake after mistake after mistake and. These things happen, it's all good.\" In North America especially, it seems like most teams have shifted their Ascent picks towards the new Deadlock comp. Seeing as this is not something that was seen at all in VCT Pacific, you've received your first experience against it in an official today. With your revival comp, what is it like to play against Deadlock on Ascent and what are some of its particular strengths and weaknesses you've noticed so far? \"Exactly what I thought the strengths would be. That comp has a lot of weaknesses; it does have its strengths for sure, but it has a lot of weaknesses. The biggest weakness is probably that if you play slow against it, it's actually really good to play against, because they don't have enough util. Small example, without KAY/O, you don't have the extra info. When you don't have the flash to reclear middle, you have to fight for it. Our comp, we have the counter util to be able to stop it, so it's like you definitely have advantages. I'm sure they have advantages. It's harder to go fast because of the Deadlock Cypher util. Deadlock's wall is really good if you're not really aware of it. You saw one round, Deadlock had full kit on the A retake and we still completely destroyed them. Her util is absolutely broken if you get into post plan situations on attack, yet we still came out on top. We felt like the comp has its merit.\" Overall, Ascent was yet another loss and the series ultimately fell 0-2. What do you think were some of the main problems with how Ascent played out? \"I think honestly, at the end of the day, we need to be able to play a clean game. If we can figure out how to consistently play at our best, we are going to be good. But if we consistently just give up and throw rounds, I don't think we're going to be very good. If this is the best that we want to be, we're already there.\" Lastly, with your loss today, you'll now have to face one of either Team Vitality or Trace Esports. Which of the two are you expecting to go against? Probably Trace? That's the expectation. I actually think Trace is pretty underrated coming out of China. I think Trace is the most macro heavy Chinese team, they have their chance to beat Vitality. do I think they're going to do it? No, I don't think they're going to. If they play like they do in scrims, they'll win actually. I expect Vitality to be able to play a pretty solid game. By the way, I just want everybody to know Vitality is sitting in the room next to us at the hotel practice room. So the two roommates are basically about to play against each other, which to me is insane."

    "cleaned_content": "Day three of Champions Seoul kicked off with a 2-0 victory from Americas top seed LEVIATÁN to take down Pacific's TALON . In a post-match press conference with members of the media, head coach Hector \" FrosT \" Rosario alongside other Talon members discussed the loss with dissatisfaction over how the game played out for the Thai side. Even with the 2-0 scoreline, this series looked like it could have been anyone's game. What would you say were the positives from your first match at Champions? Crws: \"I don't really see any positives. From my perspective, we didn't play to our potential at all. We made a lot of mistakes and if we just did what we should have done, it would have been the other way. So I don't see any positives from the game we played.\" After Bind, you said that map could have been won 13-6, but the amount of personal mistakes and inexperience played a role in your eventual defeat. Could you elaborate more on this? FrosT: \"So it's just same old, same old. Here, you're playing teams that are too good. In Pacific, maybe we don't get punished as much, but the truth is you have the 15 best teams in the world. At this point, you can't be making mistakes and giving people rounds or doing things that you're not supposed to be doing and things you know you shouldn't be doing. However, this has been a consistent problem of ours since the start of this roster. At some point, we are either going to develop and not make these mistakes or people like me are going to be out of a job.\" How do you evaluate the team's performance in the match against Leviatán compared to the expectations you had for the matchup before the tournament? FrosT: \"I thought that series went exactly...well, okay, not exactly how I thought it, but in terms of everyone thinking we had a great performance, I pretty much expected that. I expected us to win 2-0. I obviously didn't expect us to lose. However, I think it just speaks to the fact that when these guys play their best, I'm pretty sure we could beat any team in the world. The problem is, part of it is my fault, where we seem to not be as prepared as I think we are. It means I need to do a better job in preparation to make sure that we don't consistently make these mistakes, that's one. Two, if we're going to be completely honest, we've also had four rookies in franchising. Partly my fault. We went from lenne to surf, Governor obviously is a rookie this year in VCT, primmie obviously is a rookie in VCT. So because of that, you are going to have mental lapses and inexperience is going to show. That means I need to be more patient. However, there's a standard that me and Crws believe this team needs to have, and often we find ourselves not meeting that standard. But if we do meet that standard, Americas' first seed is not that big of a problem. As you guys saw, we are often our worst enemies. Until we fix that, I'm not sure how competitive we can be. But I believe that at our best we can actually win this tournament.\" FrosT, you mentioned during the post-match press conference when you guys qualified for Champions after defeating Team Secret that this is possibly Pacific's best chance at Champions and that out of all four regions, Pacific teams combined are the strongest coming to the event. After coming here and having seen some of the official matches, do you still believe that's the case or are any teams being surprised to you? FrosT: \"No, I believe that's the case. I think even today we showed it to Americas' first seed. Americas is a fan favorite in terms of strength overall, but I think actually when you play, Pacific is still at the moment the strongest region. I think all four of us can make it out of groups. If you saw today, a few rounds go differently, we are up 2-0, all of you guys are like, 'What the heck is this?' And then you see Pacific is actually nothing to mess with at the moment. I still think the top of the top though, the top of Americas and the top of EMEA certainly have good opportunities to win this, so I don't think it's going to be clean. I certainly still believe, especially after practicing and feeling all the other Americas teams, I think that if we are the fourth seed, it's unlucky for the rest.\""

    "cleaned_content": "In a clash between two of the most-hyped duelists in the world, LEVIATÁN and TALON bumped heads to open up play in Group C at Champions Seoul . Leviatán, the reigning Americas champions, came out on top 2-0. The two-map series was played out on Bind, Ascent, and Sunset, with Bind being Talon Esports's pick, Ascent being Leviatán's pick, and Sunset being the decider. Leviatán won Bind 13-11, and won Ascent 13-8, making Sunset unnecessary. Already with one Champions trophy under his belt, aspas has proven himself as one of the best duelists in the world. Opposite of the stage to him on Saturday was primmie , a rookie who made his professional debut in July in the knockout stage of Pacific Stage 2 Playoffs . Bind saw Leviatán rely on a few moments of heroic play, having to play scrappy Valorant to secure wins. Talon Esports led the match at one point, but Leviatán went on to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Leviatán 's C0M is perhaps the last player in the world you'd want to turn your back on. In round 22, with his team down two players in a 3v5, he'd play through his Viper's pit, finding a crucial triple kill to tie the game up. C0M's 3K would secure the map-tying 22nd round for Leviatán . After recovering from being put on seemingly their last leg, Leviatán would secure the next two rounds to win the map 13-11. While all eyes were trained on the Yoru of primmie, who joined Talon Esports in July and made his debut in the knockout stage of [Pacific Stage 2 Playoffs], teammate Governor impressed on Neon. Governor finished the map 20-17, which led his team in kills. After the match, Talon Esports head coach FrosT reflected on his team's performance, mentioning round-altering mistakes. “At this point you can't be making mistakes and giving people rounds or doing things that you're not supposed to be doing. This has been a consistent problem of ours since, I would say, the start of this roster,” he said. “At some point we either are going to develop and not make these mistakes, or people like me are gonna be out of a job.” Talon Esports went for an eyebrow-raising team comp on Ascent. Dubbed the ‘Zombie Comp' due to its agents having four different ways of coming back from the dead, the composition first made waves when Talon Esports used it to defeat DRX earlier this year on the same map. Playing Sage on Ascent, primmie seemed to shake off the rust of the last map. He was the bright spot on a team that found itself down 8-4 at halftime. He finished the map with a server-leading 22 kills. None of his teammates finished with more kills than deaths. Four straight rounds from Talon Esports seemed to narrow the gap between the two teams, but they would be the last rounds the Thailand-based team secured. Excellent play from aspas, who found seven out of his 16 kills came from the operator, helped Leviatán escape what would have been quite the upset. Talon Esports head coach FrosT seemed to pinpoint his team's pace of play following the match, while also acknowledging how well they played against the number-one seed from the Americas region. “This [match] should have been a very, very, very good wake-up call for them in order to make sure they tighten their things up, because this could have definitely gone the other way,” FrosT said following the match. “I do think [Leviatán] certainly deserves credit for not only beating us, but especially on Ascent, punishing us for either being too slow or too stupid in certain situations.” Leviatán will play the winner of Team Vitality and Trace Esports on August 7, while Talon Esports play the losing team on August 11."

    "cleaned_content": "FNATIC debuted strong in Champions Seoul 's second Group A matchup, taking a 2-0 over Bilibili Gaming . Following their victory, multiple moments stuck out to the press and FNATIC players alike, highlighted through several questions raised by the media in the team's post-match press conference. What are your thoughts on the Chinese Valorant teams and the region as a whole? Boaster: \"I think China definitely has some firepower in them and they have some strong teams. I think they're also late to the game, with it being released only at the start of this year officially. Like anything, we haven't seen much success from APAC until obviously Gen.G finally won. I think China will be the same; when we scrim against them, there's some players that can definitely shoot, and it's just about time and experience. I didn't start winning a trophy until three, four years into the game. I was a bit scared playing Bilibili today, but we ended up winning. What do you consider to be your team's strengths and weaknesses, and how do you plan to maintain and improve these aspects for the rest of the VCT season? Alfajer: \"I think communication is both a strength and a weakness for our team. Sometimes we can communicate as if we're a tier 3 team and other times like a really good team. Communication is a good strength and also a weakness.\" How would you describe your team's play style? Elmapuddy: \"We're pretty structured. We spend a lot of time doing so; I say we're a pretty protocols-structured team. As Alfajer was saying, we're also focusing a lot on communication because this game can get pretty hectic and there's just basically infinite outcomes and situations you can find yourself in, so we need to be able to thrive in the chaos. But we're definitely a protocols team with solid strategy.\" Knowing that Bind is Bilibili's most winnable map, how did the team play against them? Chronicle: \"We didn't have an actual strategy against them. We had some protocols and key moments they were doing and repeating from their previous matches that were an easy read. We tried to execute on them and did pretty well. Sometimes it worked perfectly, sometimes it didn't work at all because we had some mistakes on Bind. Overall, I think we did pretty well, especially considering we didn't practice this map that much. It was a strong performance from us.\" There were very solid retakes on Bind from FNATIC, especially the team's B retake. You were playing not through B Long but mostly through the B Elbow. Is there any specific reasoning for playing retake in this way? Boaster: \"I think it was actually because we didn't really know what we were doing. What would happen is they'd hit the site, and we were like, 'Let's get off; we don't know where to play.' Luckily, the retakes did work out for us on that site. We put our utility in the right positions and the kills came our way. The Bind defense was a bit of squeaky bum time, and it's going to be a good VOD review for sure. That's how we're going to get better throughout this tournament, and by the time it'll be clinch time, we're going to be ready and making the plays and running the strats.\""

Following the match, several key shortcomings were highlighted by multiple team members in a post-match press conference with the media. Champions is Flex1n's first time participating in an international event. How did you feel throughout the match and what adjustments do you think the team will make for KRU? Flex1n: \"It's not that bad because I'm holding the attitude to learn something, and I think I've learned a lot. For the next match, I think I will adjust some things in-game and be more relaxed.\" Champions is also the first international event for nephh. How does it feel representing Malaysia/Singapore and how do you feel about Champions? nephh: \"It's my first time at an international event, and I came here with the mindset of taking every match as a learning experience. We actually didn't do very well for the first match, but we definitely learned a lot, and we will do better to improve for our next game.\" What does the team think went wrong throughout the series, and what other mistakes did the team pick up on after the match? nephh: \"On Bind, I really think we had the game in our pockets. I felt like that was a game we should've won. We planted the bomb 10 times but we lost a bunch of retakes, which was good from their part, but I think our communication should've been more on point. A lot of advantageous situations came through at the end, which gave them the momentum to get a few rounds. We lost the map 13-9 but I feel like it should've been ours. For Lotus, I think our game just wasn't as good as them. We're outclassed in many aspects on that map.\" Why did whzy choose to play Neon on Lotus as opposed to Raze? whzy: \"Our kind of composition is not that traditional. The Raze pick is not that good, there are other choices now on the plate and I think maybe this composition will be better. Neon is also a super powerful agent in this patch.\" How would you describe your performance during these matches? bail: \"I think the problem is the same as our strengths, and we actually have to fix it, but I don't think we've fixed that kind of problem in our officials. I think it's kind of limited ourselves. We should just expand our advantages and lessen our mistakes. Maybe Bind we could've taken down, but after we calm down, it just kinda comes down to what we can do at that time, and I think maybe we should do more counter strategies to our opponents.\""

This is a rematch from the group stage of Champions 2023, where Fnatic defeated them 2-0 in-between the two BLG upset wins over NRG. BLG started by picking Bind, leading to Fnatic picking Lotus, leaving Ascent as the decider map. Fnatic went with double smokes and double initiator for Bind, while Bilibili stuck with a more standard Bind comp including Cypher and Brimstone. Fnatic won the pistol, but Knight helped BLG win their attack side anti-eco to get an early lead. Fnatic ended the first half up 7-5, and that lead only grew on their attack side. Any hopes of a BLG upset on map one disappeared as Fnatic took Bind 13-9. The final round looked like a win for BLG, but hiro won a 1v3 to secure the series lead. hiro clutches a 1v3 to win Bind for Fnatic. Fnatic stuck with their Lotus comp that was dominant in EMEA, while BLG put whzy on Neon to combo with their Breach and Fade. The map began with Fnatic looking unbeatable, winning pistol and converting their bonus round. It only got worse for Bilibili, as hiro and Chronicle shot their way to a 10-2 lead at the half. BLG struggling on the attack side was a bad sign, as that side is commonly the stronger one for Lotus. Fnatic won the second-half pistol round, and the series was over as Fnatic claimed Lotus 13-4 and the series 2-0. hiro, the international rookie, had an amazing debut in Seoul, while Chronicle led the series with 35 kills. Both of them ended any hopes of an upset from BLG, despite Fnatic showing some weakness on Bind. “I'm just happy that we're all happy and we have this positive energy,” Boaster said post-match. “Today, I didn't think we were at full form; Bind could've been a lot cleaner with our communication, but our Lotus didn't look bad.” With this win, Fnatic will face DRX for the first group spot in the playoff stage. Bilibili will face KRU Esports in the first elimination match of Group A."

How did it feel for you, MaKo, to be in the leadership position and having to rally your team back after the loss on Haven to eventually win the series? MaKo: \"Overall, I felt like we could have definitely won the series if we played a clean game without mistakes. After Haven, we were just like, 'Ok, it's only the first map.' We knew they had heavy hitters on the team and we knew they were a good team. It was a big loss, but it didn't take much for us mentally to recover because of how much of a gap there was with the scoreline. Going into the second and third map, we said, 'You know what? Let's pop their heads, let's shoot back, we can win this.'\" Were there any unexpected challenges or surprises from KRU today that you would say was the reason for the huge loss on Haven, and how do you recover mentally after that? BuZz: \"Coming into today, I think today we knew they were a good team and we knew how they were going to play. We were able to play our own game for maps two and three, but it was the individual talent and the amount of firepower that KRU had that took us by surprise because they were shooting better than we expected them to. On Haven, it was more on us, not to take anything away from KRU, however. For us, it was easier to mentally recover because all we had to do was reset our mentality and make sure that we played a good game, which we were able to do so.\" Seoul is the first Champions event for Foxy9, Flashback, and BeYN. How did it feel playing a match with such high stakes in the biggest event of the year? Were the three nervous, and how did they work around those initial nerves to finish the match with a victory? Foxy9: \"Of course I was feeling nervous. We put in so much preparation only to lose in such a one sided way, which made me think about we were doing and if it was worth it or not. For Abyss, it was MaKo, termi, BeYN, my teammates, and also the coaching staff who tried to keep the energy up. They exchanged a lot of nice words to make sure we had enough energy and confidence to get through the series, and I'm really grateful for them.\" BeYN: \"I didn't think that I was feeling nervous or had any stage jitters, but after we got off the stage after the first map, everyone was telling me, 'Hey, you just froze on the stage. What's going on?'. Turns out, I just wasn't aware that I had stage jitters, so I just told myself to enjoy the game a lot more and that's how I shook away my nerves to perform better in maps two and three. Flashback: \"I was super nervous, of course, but I thought about our teammates, especially the OG leaders of the team. I really wanted to deliver to their expectations and their faith that they've been putting in me. I decided to step up my game, and everything went well.\""

    "cleaned_content": "Following a 1-2 debut loss to DRX on day two of Champions Seoul , KRÜ Esports talked with various media members in a post-match press conference, opening up on several components of their opening match. We usually see keznit play Duelist for KRU, but today, he stepped into playing an Omen role on Abyss. How was the experience switching to such a different agent? keznit: “It was a really good and unique experience. I did really good on attack, but I couldn't do too much on defense. I feel like any character could be played as a Duelist.” KRU hasn't played Bind at all during the season, but today the team chose it. What was the rationale behind choosing the map? Additionally, what was with the no Duelist comp on Abyss? What led to the team taking those two decisions today against DRX? Atom: “We used to ban Bind just because we didn't have much time to prepare it, but we were so deep in the season that we said it's not worth it to start playing by then. For Champions, we decided that it was time to start playing it. We had a lot of scrims, and it was the map that we have been preparing the most, so we were very confident. It's obvious that we still need some reps to practice the map a bit more. Moreover, I feel that DRX plays better on a micro level on the map. For Abyss, the map is so new and I think it's the time when every team is trying to find their comp. We wanted to try something different like playing no Duelist. I feel as if DRX found a way to play better than us, which is why they won.” What impressions did the team get from playing Abyss and Bind? Melser: “I have a positive and negative impression. I feel like we can win these maps if we practice really well, but in maps two and three, we kinda struggled, and DRX had better micro and macro. I'm not surprised at the level of gameplay, but we just have to work a little harder to be better. We can still definitely improve and show a better face for the second match.” KRU played an incredible game on Haven, What were some of the key factors that KRU needs to keep in order to maintain a similar level? Atom: “First of all, I think we need more practice on Abyss and Bind as we have a good Haven. On that map, I think we were playing with so much strength and hype that it was hard to switch that pace for the next map. DRX was also playing good and had momentum. It's just about practicing more and getting more used to the tournament. It's a long tournament, we still have one more chance and I'm pretty sure we can fix this. Given your past mistakes, what do you think you can improve for the next match? Atom: “We can improve our drafts especially. We have at least a week to prep, which works to our advantage. We're also definitely going to prepare Abyss and Bind. It's simple for us since we already know our playstyle.”"

    "cleaned_content": "Friday's first match at Champions Seoul was the first-ever meeting between two household names in international play, with DRX defeating KRÜ Esports 2-1 in the opening stage of Group A. The roller coaster of a three-map series was played out on Haven, Abyss and Bind, with Haven being KRÜ Esports's pick, Abyss being DRX's pick, and Bind being the decider. KRÜ Esports won Haven 13-2, DRX won Abyss 13-6, and DRX won Bind 13-6. Since the beginning of VCT in 2021 KRÜ Esports has qualified for every Champions event. The same can be said of DRX, when including the Champions event that Vision Strikers qualified for in 2021 before being acquired by DRX. DRX advances to the winner's match of Group A, awaiting the winner of FNATIC and Bilibili Gaming , while KRÜ Esports will take on the losers of that match. Despite their prestige and reputation, DRX and KRÜ Esports entered Champions Seoul having never played each other and having zero VCT trophies in their rich history. KRÜ's best finish is a semifinal at Champions 2021, while DRX finished third at Champions 2022. Fans of the Pacific region may remember DRX's dominant showing on Haven against Gen.G in the Pacific Grand Finals , which saw DRX open up with a 10-2 first half on attack. Against KRÜ Esports, they'd begin on the attack side, but would this time fall victim to a large halftime deficit. On Haven, a map widely believed to be attack-sided, KRÜ Esports flipped the script, dominating on defense and claiming a 10-2 lead at halftime. keznit 's Neon found great value, setting the tone early to secure a 5-1 lead for KRU Esports. KRÜ keznit secures four kills on a C site retake on Haven Currently in his second stint with KRÜ Esports after a season with LEVIATÁN , keznit finished Haven 18-9 with a 365 ACS, while his in-game leader Melser went 22-4 with a 394 ACS on Omen. No DRX player finished with more kills than deaths. \"I think it's fortunate that it was a big loss. It didn't take much for us mentally to recover because of how much of a gap there was with the scoreline,\" Mako said of the Haven loss. \"Going into the second and third maps, we said 'You know what, let's pop their heads, shoot back, and we can win this'.” DRX did look for heads on map two, which turned out to be a roller coaster of a map. KRÜ Esports came out with an uncharacteristic comp on DRX's map pick of Abyss, opting for a no-duelist look that showed two controllers, two initiators, and one sentinel. After shaking off the rust from their last map, DRX appeared to find their footing, despite losing their anti-eco round. Flashback was the standout for the Korean team, finishing with 14 kills in the first half and playing a big part in shutting down one of two attack sites for the opponents. He'd go on to end Abyss with a server-leading 27 kills. BuZz , playing on Jett, made good use of his operator and utility, gaining crucial information against a comp with two controllers. DRX finished their defense half with an 8-4 lead. Flashback continued to find success in the attacking half, lurking into the weak side of KRÜ Esports's defense. He'd finish with four first kills, tied for the most in the server on Abyss with BuZz. DRX's attack half saw them play the post-plant much better than their counterparts, securing a handful of rounds due to bomb detonation. BeYN secures a buzzer-beating round win to bring DRX to nine. After a long technical pause due to an issue with heat 's computer, DRX didn't miss a beat, returning to close out the map, winning 13-6. KRÜ Esports seemed underprepared on Valorant's newest map yet. “It's brand new. It's a time when every team is trying to find their comp,” head coach Atom said following the match. “We wanted to try something different like playing no duelist, and I feel DRX found a way to play better than us and that's why they won.” Bind, the third and final map of the match, was KRÜ Esports's permaban for much of the 2024 season, but they opted to float it, choosing to ban Ascent and Icebox, two of DRX's stronger maps. Both teams came out with an identical composition, consisting of Brimstone, Gekko, Viper, Fade, and Raze. With DRX seizing the momentum, they'd come crashing out of the gates on Bind, winning the first four rounds en route to a 9-3 first half. The Korean team found comfort in the rounds becoming much slower, allowing themselves to make use of multi-faceted retakes. They countered KRÜ Esports's contact-up approach with the right amount of aggression through the short lanes of A and B, while Flashback again caused problems on the flank. Flashback finished with the most kills in the match with 51. Happy with the pace of their defensive half, DRX had the freedom to control the pace of their attack half. A round 17 win to give KRÜ Esports their sixth round of the match seemed to indicate the early makings of a comeback, but a crucial Thrash from Foxy9 's Gekko would put a dent in KRÜ Esports's five-man retake, securing the first of two straight rounds to secure the match for DRX. DRX Foxy9's Thrash shuts down the five-man KRÜ Esports retake. KRÜ Esports, in their fourth straight Champions event, is now one loss away from being eliminated in the group stages for a third straight time. They've been chasing the high of their 2021 semifinal finish, and must beat the loser of FNATIC and BiliBili Gaming for a chance at survival."

    "cleaned_content": "Team Heretics kicked off Valorant Champions 2024 the right way, moving past FunPlus Phoenix in a tight 2-1 Group B opener. Their Group B opening win is almost a repeat of the two teams' Masters Shanghai encounter , where Heretics took a 2-1 win which put them in the playoffs in third place. This time, in a GSL format, Heretics need just one more victory to take first place of Group B. This match also marked the return of MiniBoo to Heretics' international lineup, even if his showing was limited today. His only (unfortunate) highlight came on Abyss, where a movement error caused him to fall off the map . MiniBoo's performance was offset by RieNs ' 1.53 Abyss rating, the highest of the match. He also tabled 202 ADR and a +16 differential, all of which were the highest numbers of the server in that map. He stood out especially on attack, where he got 21 of his total 28 kills. RieNs even seemed to take the highlight of the map with a Guardian 4K, but AAAAY immediately replied with his own Guardian, clicking his way to Champions' first ace. RieNs kept his performance up, though, and led his team to a 14-12 overtime win. Tap, tap. Bind looked like it was going the opposite way, as dominant showings from all of FPX's players and their new double-controller and Chamber-based comp put the team up 10-4. RieNs and Wo0t kickstarted a small comeback for their team but, at 10-9, FPX put an end to Heretics' hopes and took the final three rounds needed to level the series. The match headed to Lotus, the only map FPX won against Heretics in Shanghai. In a much closer affair, neither FPX or Heretics found anything beyond a one-round lead in the first half. That trend maintained throughout the rest of the match and extended into overtime, where Heretics secured a 15-13 win dotted with showy plays from both sides. With that fresh comp in place on Bind, Autumn 's Chamber was at the top of the charts with six opening kills and a 1.29 rating. He was second only to benjyfishy who, despite losing the map, was the best man in the server in every category but first kills and headshot percentage: 1.40 rating, 23 kills, 11 assists, and 223 ADR. Lotus' close nature resulted in a total of twelve 3Ks between both teams, but just three clutches. Most players were also close in the stats leaderboard, with RieNs being the sole standout with a 1.33 rating. His map three performance also cemented his place as the man of the match with a 1.34 rating and +27 differential across the three maps. Check him PC. Heretics' win sets up a much-anticipated rematch between them and Gen.G. The latter took the Masters Shanghai crown in their last encounter in what was one of the best matches of the year. Gen.G will come into that winner's match off a hot 2-0 over Sentinels , avenging their own finals loss at Masters Madrid , and only one match loss since their Shanghai debut. Heretics' year has not been as clean, but they have been partially hampered due to MiniBoo's absence in overseas tournaments. Heretics may be an unstoppable force once his LAN jitters have shaken off, and they're coming for revenge. “I'm going to take my revenge,” Wo0t said in the post-match interview. “Your time is over.”"

    "cleaned_content": "Note: This article is a text port of our live interview with Sacy. The video interview can be found here . Sentinels fell 2-0 to Shanghai winners Gen.G in the opening match of Champions 2024 . Following the match, VLR.gg had the opportunity to speak to Sentinels' Gustavo \" Sacy \" Rossi regarding the defeat. Despite the defeat, Sentinels have their heads held high for what lies ahead. First off, commiserations on the loss today. The first question I'd like to ask is regarding playing the opening match here in Korea against the home crowd of Gen.G. How did it feel taking the stage today in the first Champions match, especially against the home team? “Honestly, it's all good for me because I missed Champions last year, and after all this time, I'm here. Playing against Gen.G is always fun, I know it felt like a revenge match for them because we beat them in the Madrid finals, but it's their home crowd. It was a hard match, and they're probably the favorite team to win this tournament right now, but we still have a long way to go.” Today's matchup was the third time you guys have played against Gen.G after the upper and grand finals of Madrid. Heading into the match, were there any thoughts in your mind about playing them once again in your opening match? “Not really, I think Gen.G got better for sure, but they didn't change that much about their playstyle. They play the same way they did in Madrid, but in a better way.” Sentinels came into Haven with Cypher in place of the traditional Killjoy, which hasn't been seen once in 2024. Was this change made specifically for Gen.G's Viper comp on Haven, or are there other advantages to playing Cypher on Haven over Killjoy? “I think it was a mix of both. We thought that Cypher would be good against Gen.G, especially against a Viper comp, and Cypher is pretty good right now as the main sentinel of a team.” How different could Haven have played out if the initial pistol round went in your favor, seeing as Sentinels were able to take four rounds in a row following Kim \" Meteor \" Tae-oh (김태오) 's 1v2 clutch? “The pistol would have changed a lot, but even if we lost that pistol, I thought we had control the entire game, but we lost some clutch rounds. We kinda changed our default on attack, and I feel like it's easy to say now after the game, but I felt like [changing] wasn't necessary at all, and we kinda tried to rush a lot of times. The pistol would have been a big change, but I'll be honest with you, we don't need that to win a game.” Gen.G has tendencies to mount momentum during games after taking rounds. From round 9 on Haven and onwards, Sentinels only won one round before Gen.G reached match point. What were some of the difficulties in stopping Gen.G's momentum-heavy playstyle on Haven specifically? “What really happened was that we couldn't stop their lurks. We got caught three or four times, which snowballed from there and it was really, really tough to deal with. We didn't need to change anything we were doing, we just needed to be more careful with our fundamentals. We should've been more ready regarding their momentum.” Haven ended 8-13 for Sentinels with the team also going 0/3 in clutches throughout the map. What was discussed after Map 1 to help fix some errors heading into Ascent? “As you said, the clutches were really important, especially the round with Kim \" t3xture \" Na-ra (김나라) 's 1v2 with three HP. After that clutch, we weren't playing as confident as we should like how we used to play. After that map, we noted that we needed to be more confident and to trust ourselves. It's like we're playing like kittens, you know? We're playing to hide instead of shooting their heads. I hope after this series, we're gonna wake up for our next match.” The Deadlock-Cypher composition on Ascent is one quickly seeing rising popularity worldwide. From the team's experience, what value do these agents bring over the more traditional Ascent picks such as KAY/O and Cypher? “I feel like Deadlock and Cypher is kind of the comp that counters Ascent's KAY/O meta right now. I can't say too much since we still have a match to play, so we might try to hide some stuff.” Similar to the previous question about Gen.G's momentum on Haven, similar patterns followed on Ascent. Were there any other difficulties with countering Gen.G's momentum, or did the same problems from Haven emerge? “I still need to watch Ascent, but right now all I can say is that we got outclassed on Ascent. They played really well, we couldn't deal with them. They also played really slow, and they played really good against Cypher and Deadlock. We weren't able to adapt during the game, so it's kind of our fault, but it's also like their job. They did their job really well.” Gen.G is not a light team to go against. How do you or the team view the loss here today as you head into the lower bracket and are there any main takeaways? “I'm going to go back and watch the game for sure, but we know that Gen.G played good, however we didn't play that good against them, so we didn't come against them for a real match. It's more important for us to come back for the lower match and that's it. It doesn't matter who we face, we know that they're both good teams and we've got to be ready for them.” Lastly, despite the loss, Sentinels will now be playing one of Team Heretics or FunPlus Phoenix in the lower bracket. Which team are you personally more excited to play against? “I wish I could play Team Heretics again. It's always fun to play against them, they're a really good team. We'll see, but to play against them they need to lose, so who knows?” Sentinels are now set to play against one of either Team Heretics or FunPlus Phoenix in the lower bracket of Group B."

    "cleaned_content": "Thursday's opening match of Champions Seoul saw a rematch between the two grand finalists of Masters Madrid , with Gen.G and Sentinels squaring off for the third time this year. A clash between the two Masters champions of the 2024 season saw Gen. G, with their Korean home crowd behind them, claim a dominant 2-0 victory. The two-map series was played out on Haven and Ascent, with Haven being Sentinels' pick and Ascent being Gen. G's pick. Gen.G won Haven 13-8 and clinched Ascent 13-7 to close the series. The match was the first of two opening stage matches in Group B. Gen. G will await the winner of FunPlus Phoenix and Team Heretics , while Sentinels will play the losing team in an elimination match. Gen.G clinched three pistol rounds and three anti-eco rounds, securing them six rounds out of the 26 that would require a win in a two-map match. With Gen.G virtually being the home team and beginning three out of four halves of the match with momentum on their side, they'd secure a revenge victory over the only team to have beaten them on the international stage. Gen. G seemed to overcome the nightmares they suffered on Haven against DRX in the Pacific Grand Finals , where they had secured just two rounds on the defensive half. In the closing stages of the first half, in which Gen. G began on defense, a seemingly surefire Sentinels round was flipped in favor of Gen. G, with t3xture securing a 1v2 clutch on just 3 HP to give the Korean outfit a 6-5 lead. t3xture's 1v2 clutch with the Operator to secure six rounds for Gen.G. With a mix of excellent retakes, individual heroics, and excellent reads from Munchkin , the Pacific region's IGL of the year, Gen. G secured map one 13-8 – seven of those rounds coming on the presumably tougher defensive half. Gen.G duelist t3xture finished the map 24-12 with an ACS of 305. All the while, Gen.G made life tough for Sentinels duelist zekken , who finished Haven 7-19 with an ACS of 115. The Haven win comes weeks after Gen.G was dismantled by fellow Korean superpower DRX in the Pacific Grand Finals. On DRX's attack half, Gen.G managed just two rounds. On two occasions, Gen.G's in-game leader Munchkin, playing on Viper, paved the way for a plant on A site via a lurk through A short, securing a man advantage and a free site. Despite recent changes in the meta, Munchkin found relative success on Viper. Gen.G's coaching staff of solo and HSK seem to still see positives in the controller agent, even if she only has one Snake Bite now. “Personally, I've been telling the coaching staff, ‘I don't want to play Viper', but the coaching staff still believe Viper is still a viable and very strong agent in a lot of the maps,” Munchkin said following the match. “The nerf isn't to the point where it would hurt the games or the strategies that we run, so I think that's why we still run the Viper.” After snatching Sentinels's map pick away from them, Gen.G marched into their own map pick of Ascent with the confidence of a team possessing home-field advantage. On a map widely regarded as being defense-sided, Gen.G finished their first half, their attack half, with eight rounds secured against Sentinels's double-sentinel team comp. On the defensive side to open the map and with johnqt and Zellsis on Deadlock and Cypher, Sentinels should have had an advantage. However, Gen.G's multi-level attack, which utilized Munchkin's KAY/O NULL/cmd, Meteor 's Killjoy Lockdown and Lakia 's Sova Hunter's Fury, locked down Gen.G's attack half. Four of their eight attack half wins came from spike detonations. Karon 3K to bring Gen.G to match point. After securing eight rounds on their attack half, Gen.G went on to secure five of eight rounds on defense to secure the map and the match. On Haven, Gen.G's Karon finished with the most kills in the server, also having two separate 4K's on the map. The consensus rookie of the year frontrunner continues his dominant form and looks to push Gen.G to a miraculous sixth Grand Final this year. Gen.G's match against the winner of FunPlus Phoenix and Team Heretics will take place on August 6, while Sentinels will take on the losing team on August 10."

Ahead of Split 2 , Boom added ZesBeeW to their roster, whose strong performance contributed to another flawless group stage record. However, once again, Boom was bested by Alter Ego in playoffs, dropping to the lower bracket. After a dominant lower bracket run, Boom rematched Alter Ego in the grand final and won 3-2, achieving their first playoff victory against AE in 2024. Famouz , Shiro , and ZesBeeW were all standout players in Split 2, ranking first, second, and third in rating.

Regardless, they still remained a favorite for the Thailand Challengers League title after qualifying for the LAN Ascension Qualifier Series on circuit points. However, after being trounced by MiTH in the upper final, it seemed Full Sense would narrowly miss out on Ascension again.

Really grateful with what I lived with them and all the teammates that I had throughout this years,” he said in his X post. Klaus was with KRU since 2021, and was one of the last remaining Americas players to remain on the same organization since the beginning of VCT.

Last year's Home Ground event saw FNATIC claim the trophy in Japan after narrowly defeating Cloud9 in a five-map thriller. Red Bull will continue to have teams compete in-person this year as opposed to online. Three EMEA teams have been invited to the main event. Last year's champions FNATIC will be joined by Karmine Corp and FOKUS on the big stage. Three additional tickets will be rewarded to the winners of the NA, APAC, and EMEA qualifiers, with the last two up for grabs for the first and second place Play-In teams. FNATIC claimed two trophies in Tokyo last year. (Photo: Jason Halayko / Red Bull Content Pool) Furthermore, the North American qualifiers will take place in the form of a LAN event in Seattle, Washington beginning September 29. Cloud9 and Sentinels are among some of the invited teams that will not have to partake in the open qualifiers. The winning team will claim the biggest portion of the $20,000 prize pool as well as an appearance at the World Finals in November. The Arena Berlin is a 17,000-seat venue located in Berlin, Germany. Last year's venue in Japan could hold up to 11,000 spectators, meaning that this year's crowd could be considerably bigger. Red Bull will unveil more invited teams for all qualifiers as the tournaments loom closer. Home Ground #5 will serve as a great way for teams to hone their skills and strategies against both regional and international competition.

    "cleaned_content": "The Challengers Leagues in Brazil and Latin America have concluded, and two teams from each region have locked in their spots for Americas Ascension . Ascension is the annual clash between Challengers teams to claim one available spot in VCT Americas. In 2023, The Guard (now G2 Esports ) became the first team in Americas to ascend and will represent the region at Champions this week. The top two teams from North America, Brazil, and LATAM will play in a single round robin group stage, each match a best-of-three. The top four teams from the group stage will face off in a double elimination playoff bracket to crown a champion. Challengers League Brazil: Galorys and 2Game Esports Galorys was the first Brazilian team to secure their place in Ascension with a 3-1 victory over THE 7 in the grand finals of Split 2 on Sunday. After an underwhelming 3-6 regular season in Split 2, the team rallied and blazed a path through play-ins and playoffs, only dropping a series to THE 7 in the upper bracket final . Despite THE 7's higher placement in playoffs, Galorys' victory sent 2Game Esports to Ascension based on circuit points. 2Game amassed 115 points versus THE 7's 80 throughout the year. The four-map final opened with a thrilling 13-11 victory for THE 7 on Lotus. However, Galorys successfully adapted to THE 7's Iso-centric double duelist compositions and comfortably took Bind 13-8, Split 13-6, and Ascent 13-7. Both teams' controller players distinguished themselves; THE 7's pollo recorded top kills on three out of four maps, while lukxo demonstrated a 20/10 K/D on Bind and a server-high 1.20 rating in the series. Galorys' duelist Sato also consistently performed throughout the series with an impressive 270 ACS and 171 ADR. All 10 of the players representing Brazil are newcomers to Ascension and will compete for the most coveted prize in Challengers. Challengers League LATAM: RETA Esports and All Knights In Latin America, the top two teams in circuit points from the LATAM North and LATAM South leagues converged in a four team double-elimination bracket to qualify the top two teams. RETA Esports defeated All Knights in an exceptional 3-2 reverse sweep in the winner's match to secure the first spot on Saturday. All Knights took Haven and Lotus convincingly, with All Knights' duelist Dantedeu5 leading with a combined 42 kills and 13 first kills to only one first death. However, RETA rebounded on Bind thanks to headliner performances from two familiar faces: NagZ and delz1k , both of whom formerly played for KRÜ Esports . The last two maps were strong displays of mental fortitude from RETA as they won Ascent 13-10 from behind 10-7 score and Abyss 13-9 from an 8-8 score. All Knights had one last chance to qualify in the decider match against E-Xolos LAZER the next day and capitalized on it in a close 3-2 victory. The five-map series played out in back-and-forth fashion. At first, it seemed that the previous loss had affected All Knights as they dropped Haven 13-5, where E-Xolos' duelist Virtyy dropped a stunning 27 kills and 436 ACS. However, All Knights countered with a 13-5 of their own on Sunset. Map three was the closest in the series, with All Knights barely closing out Lotus 13-11 after a dominant 10-2 first half. In the decider on Ascent, All Knights sealed E-Xolos' fate on the back of a remarkable performance from Cebando on Omen, who racked up 22 kills and a 1.75 rating. Virtyy topped the scoreboard for the series with 98 kills, 30 of which were first kills. Of the 10 players representing LATAM, NagZ, delz1k, murizzz (formerly of MIBR ), and adverso (formerly of LEVIATÁN ) will seek returns to tier one, while the rest will reach for the summit as fresh faces. The best of the best will vie for the ultimate prize. (Photo by Pavilhão Pacaembu/Riot Games) Ascension Ascension will begin on Sept. 10 in Monterrey, Mexico. The six participating teams will compete in a round robin of best-of-three matches, with the top four advancing to the double elimination playoff stage starting Sept. 18. The teams qualified for Ascension are: Galorys (Brazil) 2Game Esports (Brazil) RETA Esports (LATAM North) All Knights (LATAM South) M80 (North America) TSM (North America)"

    "cleaned_content": "In their journey to reaching VCT in the 2025 season, two Challengers League teams punched their tickets to Tokyo for the Champions Tour Pacific: Ascension this week. Ascension is the unforgiving gauntlet that is the opportunity for a Tier 2 team to reach the VCT. In last year's rendition, BLEED were crowned champions of the competition and earned a two-year stay in VCT. In the Pacific region, champions of ten regions are set to compete in two groups of five, with a modified double-elimination narrowing the groups down to three teams that will compete in a single-elimination tournament. WDG Challengers League Korea: Sin Prisa Gaming On Saturday, Sin Prisa Gaming continued their undefeated form in Split 2, defeating Nongshim RedForce in five maps. The win came despite a stellar Split 2 for Nongshim Redforce's SID , who was named the MVP of the stage. Meanwhile, Sin Prisa Gaming's Ivy was named the MVP of the Grand Finals. On map 3, Sunset, Sin Prisa Gaming controller player Persia impressed, finishing with a team-leading 20 kills in a 13-5 win. Persia would perform consistently throughout all five maps, finishing with a team-high 78 kills. Nongshim Redforce's Xross finished with 84 kills, the most in the server. The series was back-and-forth, with no team winning two consecutive maps. The team that picked the map would go on to win the map every time, leaving the fifth map to be the decider. On map five, Nongshim Redforce seemed to ride the momentum of a dominant map four, jumping out to a 7-3 lead on Abyss. When the map flipped and they were tasked with defending, they ran into troubles against the lurks of Sin Prisa Gaming's margaret , who had exclusively played Cypher in 2024. By the time they had figured out how to stop him, it was already too late. Sin Prisa Gaming would win eight out of the final nine rounds to cap off an undefeated Split 2 and declare themselves champions. Challengers League Japan: RIDDLE ORDER On Sunday's VCL Japan Grand Final, RIDDLE ORDER would complete a dramatic reverse sweep, avoiding what would have been just their third loss of 2024 and their second of Split 2, defeating FENNEL 3-2. RIDDLE ORDER found themselves in an unfamiliar spot. They had dominated their competition coming into the playoffs, boasting a 6-1 record and having only dropped three maps in Split 2. A 2-0 Upper Final win over Sengoku Gaming seemed to suggest they hadn't missed a beat, but Sunday's bout with FENNEL proved to be a challenge. In the first meeting between the two teams, RIDDLE ORDER would make quick work of FENNEL, winning 2-0, though both maps were closely contested. In the rematch with the stakes higher than ever, FENNEL would seal the first two maps in convincing fashion. However, the two sides were locked into a standstill midway through map three on Bind. A long tech pause would lock FENNEL to their seats, just five rounds away from securing a 3-0 sweep and a spot in Ascension. After finally returning to play after over an hour, RIDDLE ORDER would storm back to win the map with a reverse sweep on their minds. On map four, a showdown between SyouTa and Seoldam 's Jetts would define the outcome, with Seoldam's 27 kills, nine by way of the operator, paving the way for a winner-takes-all map five. In the decider, RIDDLE ORDER, through excellent team play and a hot start to their attack side, would lift the trophy, marching onwards to Ascension. The match would end at 9:35 p.m. local time, five maps and over seven hours after it began at 2 p.m. in the Ariake GYM-EX in Tokyo. Last year, Japanese VCL team SCARZ lost in the final of Ascension. Now, RIDDLE ORDER will look to do what SCARZ could not do against BLEED last year: win Ascension and gain entry into VCT. BLEED were last year's Pacific Ascension champions (Photo by Riot Games) Ascension Ascension will kick off on September 14. The ten regional champions will compete in two different modified double-elimination groups, with the top-three finishers of the groups advancing to a six-team, single-elimination knockout stage. Riot has not yet announced information on how the teams will be seeded. The top teams of the Alpha and Omega groups will earn a bye into the semifinals, while the second and third place teams will be pitted against each other in an elimination match. The tournament will take place across seven days in a ten-day time frame. The teams currently qualified for Ascension are: Revenant Esports (South Asia) FULL SENSE (Thailand) Disguised (Malaysia/Singapore) Sin Prisa Gaming (Korea) Oblivion Force (Hong Kong/Taiwan) Justice For Tomorrow (Oceania) RIDDLE ORDER (Japan) Champions from the Vietnam, Phillipines and Indonesia regions will round out the rest of the Ascension field."

    "cleaned_content": "Regional champions have been crowned yet again, as the second split of the EMEA Challenger Leagues has come to a close. The top two teams of each region will now focus on Ascension to fight for a VCT spot. Ascension is the opportunity for a Tier 2 team to reach the VCT. The champions of each of the nine regions are placed straight into the main event, while the nine second-best teams will have to slog through a Play-Ins stage before they fight in the main event for a VCT slot. Challengers League Spain: Barça eSports and KPI Gaming The first team to find their Ascension slot was Barça eSports . The Spanish roster had a lowly first stage, finishing down in sixth, but switched gears in the second half of the season. Barcelona finished at the top of the table in the regular season, second only to UCAM Esports Club , but ended up taking the cup in the playoffs with a 3-2 over UCAM. Ironically, Barça only has two players in the top 15 of the Split 2 ratings leaderboard. That space was mostly taken up by KPI Gaming and UCAM, despite the former's third-place finish in the tournament. Challengers League DACH: MOUZ and CGN Esports While Spain fielded two new teams to Ascension, DACH's teams are no strangers to Ascension. CGN Esports and MOUZ placed first and second for the region last year, and swapped places this year, with MOUZ taking the regional championship and relegating CGN to the Ascension Play-ins. CGN and MOUZ hold one of the longest-standing rivalries in the VCT ecosystem, having battled fifteen times since early 2022. The former has only found five wins in that time, four of them in playoff bouts. Challengers League Portugal: SAW and PedroPedroPedro Back in the Iberian Peninsula, SAW took the Portuguese crown for the fourth time in a row, this time over PPP . PPP were born out of the ashes of ELEVATE , who dropped their roster after Stage 1. SAW then dominated the regular season with just one loss, but succumbed to the reigning champions in the playoffs. With this win, SAW managed to become one of just three teams across Europe to reach a fourth consecutive VCL title, after Apeks and Team Falcons . Apeks and Falcons can still extend their streak in the coming splits, though, while SAW can't due to the merging of the Italian and Portuguese leagues into Spain. for the foreseeable future, as the league will merge with Italy and Spain Challengers League France: Joblife and VALIANT France was dominated by Joblife this year, who hold former FNATIC sixth-man kamyk in their ranks. Despite a rough regular season where they finished fourth, one match shy of missing playoffs, Joblife took a clean win over Team Valiant in the grand final, having dropped just one map in the match prior to Zerance . Joblife's victory also gave coach LohaN a third VCL trophy, making him one of the most decorated coaches of Tier 2. He is second only to SAW's mowzassa and Apeks' DANNYTO , as both have four titles to their names. The climb to the top begins once more. (Photo by Hara Amorós/Riot Games) Challengers League Türkiye: Pcific and Galakticos PCIFIC Esports took the Turkish league by storm, ending the season in fourth but finishing the playoffs head and shoulders above the rest of the competition. HOWL Esports took second place, but Galakticos secured the Ascension Play-In slot as they accrued more points over the course of the season. Turkey's champions are a success story for the VCT ecosystem, having joined the VCL midway through the season after climbing in from Premier. Pcific are the first team to come up from Premier and conquer a trophy in Tier 2. Now, they are just a few matches shy of reaching the pinnacle of Valorant. Challengers League North: Apeks and SweetNsour Much like SAW, Apeks completed their regional dominance and took home yet another trophy. They also did so in dominant fashion: Apeks dropped just one match in the regular season, and put together a flawless playoffs run to claim a fourth North title, taking a 3-0 final over SweetNsour . Apeks' win has allowed them to match SAW's four consecutive VCL titles in a row. It also tied mowzassa and DANNYTO as the most decorated VCL coaches, but they each find themselves in highly different circumstances heading into the final months of the year. The Portuguese league is disappearing, while Apeks were and are a hot VCT contender from the North — heading into the final months of the year. Challengers League Italy: DSYRE and NOVO Esports DSYRE was equally consistent this year, scoring two first-place regular season finishes and two Italy titles. The team spent the better part of the year keeping NOVO at bay, who finished second in both splits of the year. DSYRE leave Italy as its undisputed champions. They faltered in the 2023 opening split, dropping the final to GMT Esports , but have scored three season titles in a row since — a fourth one in the OFF//SEASON — and will represent Italy in Ascension for the second year in a row. Challengers League MENA: Falcons and R8 Esports Team Falcons maintained their streak of gold over in MENA. Against Levant/NA champions R8 Esports , Falcons took a drawn-out 3-2 victory to claim yet another MENA trophy. It was the Falcons' second win over R8 in the playoffs, having already bested them in the upper finals in 2-1 fashion, leaving the latter to fend for themselves in Ascension Play-Ins. Their 2024 Split 2 trophy is the ninth the team has won in MENA since the team's creation. It is also their fourth in a row — partially due to the regional split between GCC/Iraq and Levant/NA — despite placing second in the first Split of 2021. Challengers League East: GoNext Esports and Diamant Esports Going into the grand final, GoNext Esports and Diamant Esports already had their first and second slots, respectively, locked in going into the grand final. GoNext were still chasing victory, though, and secured it after a 3-1 over their foes in the grand final, taking back-to-back trophies in the East in the process. Eastern Europe stands out from the crowd, as they are one of just two subregions to take two new representatives to Ascension alongside Spain. Acend and Enterprise fought for the VCT last year, but both fell out of the top three this year. Ascension Ascension kicks off tomorrow, July 28, with a format identical to last year's. The second-place teams of each league will fight amongst themselves in the play-ins, which are split into a group stage and playoff stage and will run until August 1. The winner from the play-in stage will join the nine VCL champions in Ascension, which also has a group stage and playoffs. Ascension itself will be held between August 31 and September 15 and its winner will receive a one-year ticket to the VCT. Unlike last year, though, only the lower bracket final and the grand final of Ascension will be played at the Riot Games Arena. In 2023, the entire playoffs were hosted in the Berlin-based studio. The Ascension teams are: Barça eSports (Spain) MOUZ (DACH) SAW (Portugal) Joblife (France) PCIFIC Esports (Turkey) Apeks (North) DSYRE (Italy) Team Falcons (MENA) GoNext Esports (East) The Play-Ins teams are: KPI Gaming (Spain) CGN Esports (DACH) PPP (Portugal) Team Valiant (France) Galakticos (Turkey) SweetNsour (North) NOVO Esports (Italy) R8 Esports (MENA) Diamant Esports (East)"

    "cleaned_content": "LEVIATÁN took home the VCT: Americas Stage 2 trophy after taking down G2 Esports in a close series. The win gives Leviatán their first championship and secures their spot as the #1 seed from Americas for Champions 2024 . For G2, it's another finish just a step short of a title, following their third place finish at Masters Shanghai , and second place finish in the Stage 1 playoffs . The teams met up for the fourth time this season, with G2 handling Leviatán fairly easily in the upper bracket final in the most recent matchup. G2 opted to veto Icebox and Sunset with their two map ban advantage, taking out Leviatán's best map and G2's permaban respectively. G2 chose to open the best-of-five on Lotus. aspas picked Neon for the first map, a notable selection considering the star's relative struggles on the agent against KRÜ Esports . Those issues were soon forgotten as the duelist quickly surpassed his lower final kill total on the agent. The first half was headlined by valyn 's dominant performance, leading the lobby with 15 kills and calling a strong defensive side. icy started off the series about as well as anyone could ask for. Leviatán fought back on their own defense side by winning a few critical low-buy rounds despite constant struggles in retake situations. Led by star plays from Mazino and aspas, Leviatán upped their aggression and pace early on defense to force overtime after facing a 9-6 deficit. Spurred by two uses of Mazino's Breach ultimate in overtime, Leviatán surprised the favored G2 by taking map one 15-13. It was more of the same from Mazino to finish, as the initiator elevated his already impressive play by finding 18 kills in the final nine rounds on Lotus. In total, he earned 34 kills across the map, the most of any player in Americas Stage 2. The chaotic energy carried over into Haven, with three thrifty rounds converted in the first four rounds of the map. The map played out similar to the first one but with the roles reversed, as G2 used great retake executions to bounce back from a 10-7 losing position and force another overtime. tex is always good for a highlight clip every match. Overtime on Haven was marked by massive team fights and flurries of trades. Once again, however, it was Mazino who closed the door on G2 with a 3K and Breach ultimate in the final round to secure a 16-14 win and bring Leviatán one map away from a title. The economy management was a major reason why Leviatán got the win on Haven, even without converting a pistol round win. The mixed Americas squad put together 24 full buy rounds compared to their opponents' 15. Momentum switched here for a little bit with this 2v5. While it was much more of a team effort for Leviatán than in the first map, C0M in particular was key in the win. Always good to cause disruption with a timely flank, he led the lobby with 28 kills. Leviatán looked to close out the series on Bind in 3-0 fashion. Even with a miraculous 2v5 from leaf and icy, G2 were faced with a 8-2 hole to begin the map. A major round saw C0M continue his stellar play from the previous map with a 1v2 to break the G2 economy. The post plant setups from G2 were messy, as players were continuously picked off early on into retakes from Leviatán. A 3v5 win to finish the half at 8-4 kept G2's hopes alive heading into their attack half. If C0M is in Champions 2023 form, watch out for Leviatán. Piggybacking off the nice finish to the first half, G2 flipped the script by winning their own retakes and opening defensive duels to buoy themselves out to a 9-8 lead. A 1v1 win for C0M was the only positive for Leviatán in the second half as they dropped their first map in the series 13-9. Of the 19 rounds where the bomb was planted, 14 of them ended in defusals. Leaf played extremely well on the map, leading the lobby with a whopping 232 ADR. JonahP came alive after a slow first half, and his 15-2 performance on G2's defense half was a major reason why G2 dominated the back end of the map. On Ascent, it was aspas' attack Operator play that headlined the first half. G2 hardly fought for early map control on the defensive side, allowing aspas to pick off several unsuspecting players throughout multiple rounds on the way to a strong 8-4 half for Leviatán. A deserved celebration for the Americas champions. Those four rounds would be all that G2 would see on Ascent. Across their five attack rounds, only valyn and JonahP would contribute to the eight kills G2 found as aspas ran rampant on Jett to secure Leviatán their first VCT Americas championship. Mazino finished with an impressive 90 kills across just four maps to lead the way, with aspas not far behind at 81. Not a single player for Leviatán finished negative across the series even with the overtime battles to begin the match. In contrast, leaf was G2's only player who managed more kills than the lowest fragger on Leviatán. The win for Leviatán felt like a long time coming after many labeled the roster a superteam during the offseason. C0M and aspas will have a chance to become the only two-time Champions winners in Seoul. For a G2 squad that had dropped just two maps since returning from a top-three finish at Masters Shanghai, it was a disappointing result. There were some uncharacteristic misplays throughout the series that cost them rounds at critical junctures. Leviatán were placed into Group C for Champions 2024 alongside Talon Esports, Team Vitality, and Trace Esports. G2 are the second seed in Group D, facing off against Paper Rex, EDward Gaming, and FUT Esports."

    "cleaned_content": "Gen.G have claimed their third VCT title with a 3-1 victory over DRX in a series that featured two nailbiter overtime maps. As the upper bracket team, Gen.G were given two map bans to DRX's zero in the best-of-five series. Sunset has traditionally been one of Gen.G's most frequent bans, with it being their first ban 80% of the time at Masters Madrid . Gen.G have opted to first-ban Abyss for the entirety of the VCT Pacific Stage 2 playoffs and have yet to play the new map. Gen.G are still the kings of Pacific. (Image via Riot Games) Despite most VCT teams having moved away from it, Gen.G continued to run the double-controller Haven composition initially popularized by The Guard . DRX figured out how to handle the off-meta playstyle and sped to a blistering 9-0 lead. BuZz looked unstoppable with 16 kills and 342 ACS in the first half. Some individual play from t3xture and Lakia let Gen.G pick up two rounds towards the end of the half but the deficit would be too much for the favorites to overcome. A Gen.G pistol and a win in the first gun round did little to end DRX's dominance on Haven as the newly MaKo -led squad looked composed on all fronts. DRX ended the map with a clean C site retake to gain a 1-0 lead in the series with a 13-6 scoreline. The two DRX veterans, BuZz and MaKo, continued to be the top two performers for their side with 19 and 17 kills respectively. DRX excelled in winning opening duels with a 78% win rate thanks to the exploitation of struggling site anchors. Gen.G struggled to find info in the mid-round with a solo Skye initiator and failed to get the heavy stacks on site they are known for. t3xture looked off from his normal self on Haven. Gen.G returned to form in the first half of Bind. Despite losing the pistol, Gen.G picked up the thrifty in the following round thanks to a heroic 3K from Lakia. While DRX struggled in the gun rounds, they took four thrifty rounds to keep themselves in the game and keep Gen.G's lead slim at 7-5. Munchkin and Lakia were a constant thorn in the side of DRX on the B site against a DRX that stumbled haphazardly into Viper utility. DRX capitalized on the pistol the second time around thanks to a 1v1 clutch from BuZz to tie up the score at 7-7. Gen.G once again performed in the gun rounds to take a 10-7 lead before BuZz's Operator found back-to-back multikills in rounds 18 and 19, forcing a Gen.G timeout. A Lakia 1v1 followed to enable a Gen.G map point at 12-9. Three straight hero plays from DRX with 1v1s from Flashback and BeYN preceded an explosive 3K from BuZz to force overtime. Lakia's early game highlights turned out to be crucial after Bind's quintuple overtime. Chaotic rounds ensued with a Judge buy from Karon picking up a first blood in round 25 followed by a stuck defuse in a 4v4 from MaKo to keep the score even. Four more hectic sets of overtime ensued before Gen.G managed to close out the map after 34 rounds at 18-16. While the entirety of Gen.G ended Bind with a positive K/D, it was in-game leader Munchkin who provided the numbers necessary to take it over the line with 34 kills and a 1.44 rating. The kill spread for the rest of Gen.G was near even with Karon, t3xture, and Meteor on 27 kills each. Despite trailing his teammates in kills, Lakia had a server-high KAST at 82% and took home the only successful clutch for his team. The individuals spearheaded DRX's rounds with 44% of their round wins coming from clutches. BuZz led the way with 33 kills and 280 ACS. DRX's star duelist took advantage of every opportunity to find value with the Operator and provided multikills in the most crucial moments. BuZz kept DRX in the game. Consecutive clutches from Flashback and MaKo halted a three-round streak from Gen.G to kick off Lotus. The individual performance from DRX was the story of the series so far with a thrifty in round seven thanks to a double entry kill with a Bucky from BuZz's Neon. Gen.G mustered just a single round for the rest of the half after a 1v2 from Karon. Flashback's Chamber found consistent opening picks to neutralize Gen.G's A-Rubble takes and force a 7-5 half for DRX. A 2v4 from Karon and Munchkin gifted Gen.G their second pistol to start their attack. Gen.G brutally forced through the DRX's defenses with multiple fast hits to pick up the bonus and following gun round to lead 11-8. Some excellent shots from Flashback and Foxy9 brought DRX back into the game to even up the score at 11-11 and force Gen.G onto an eco. A clutch last-second defuse from BeYN to put DRX on match point before his team fumbled a 5v3 and conceded another overtime. This time around Gen.G would close things out quickly with back-to-back opening picks from t3xture's Operator facilitating a quick two rounds, putting Gen.G up in the series 2-1 after a 14-12 on Lotus. t3xture and Meteor paired up to top the scoreboard for Gen.G with 24 kills each. t3xture's late-game Operator nullified Flashback's earlier success with the weapon and pushed Gen.G to another overtime win. DRX's three clutches in the first half propelled them to a strong start but BeYN's solitary clutch to follow wasn't enough to secure the map. Karon made up for a weaker overall performance with some excellent clutch moments. DRX moved off of their standard Clove composition on Icebox in favor of a more run-of-the-mill double initiator, but the gamble failed to pay off. A pistol win and 1v2 on eight HP from Flashback kicked off a streak of three rounds for DRX on Icebox before Gen.G responded with a thrifty. DRX could pick up just two more rounds to make the half 7-5 after a monstrous performance from Meteor with 15 kills. Gen.G's insistence on quickly refighting into A frequently caught DRX off guard before their site executes. Gen.G dropped just a single round during their attacking half and dominated their competition across the board. A statement 13-6 win on Icebox secured the grand finals in a 3-1 series for Gen.G. Meteor's 20 kills and 181 ADR were too much for his opponents as the Killjoy powered many of Gen.G's swing-round wins. Gen.G are the VCT Pacific Stage 2 champions. Gen.G have come victorious in the VCT Pacific Stage 2 playoffs and will enter Champions 2024 as Pacific's number one seed. DRX have claimed Pacific's second seed for Champs."

    "cleaned_content": "In a nailbiter that went all five maps, LEVIATÁN defeated KRÜ Esports for the fourth time this VCT season, and the second time in the Americas Stage 2 playoffs . The series went back and forth with dominant performances from each team across various maps. KRÜ's season is not over, as they will represent Americas at Champions after clinching their fourth consecutive Champions berth. Leviatán will play G2 Esports for a chance at their first trophy and to be the first seed for Americas at Champions. KRÜ had gone into the match hoping for an end to their troubles against Leviatán, having most recently managed just six rounds in the upper semifinals in their third loss against their LATAM rivals in just three months. The teams had differing reactions to their most recent showdown, with KRÜ clinching their fourth straight Champions berth in a nail-biter with 100 Thieves . Leviatán had a let down with an uninspiring 2-0 loss against G2 Esports Leviatán looked for a similar opening to their 13-2 first map victory on Thursday, opting to play on Icebox once again. The mixed Americas roster had not fallen on the map in eight straight tries prior to stalling against G2. A 3K pistol opener from Shyy provided a spark of hope for his team, but the pistol rounds were quite literally the only positive on Icebox for KRÜ. The clip that encapsulates Icebox. Ultimately it was the exact same story of domination for the first map, with Leviatán in control the entire time en route to a 13-3 victory. aspas and tex combined for 31 kills on their attack. KRÜ tried to switch things up by placing keznit on Reyna, but the star duelist managed just one kill in the first half. A mirror matchup with two Neons on Haven resulted in a battle of site hits and aggressive teamplay in a back-and-forth affair. KRÜ instantly looked more comfortable on their map pick, staving off Mazino's hot start to reach a 7-7 stalemate. The finish would not deviate from the rest of the map. Melser picked up a 1v2 in a critical round 22 to bring the score to 11-11. C0M was left in three different 1vX situations in the final trio of rounds but failed to convert, leaving KRÜ with a 13-11 victory. Not the most well played round you'll see in VCT. KRÜ put together six successful retakes in nine possible attempts on their defensive side. Keznit looked more like his usual self in map two, leading his squad with 27 kills and five first bloods. The momentum from map two carried over to Sunset as KRÜ pummeled Leviatán to start on Sunset. Aspas' struggles (by his standards), carried over from Haven as he managed just three kills in the first half. A 2v4 clutch to finish out their attack side put KRÜ 9-3 up in a pivotal map three. The KRÜ B site executes just couldn't be stopped even with a variety of Cypher setups from tex. Leviatán finally converted their first pistol round of the series to kick off the second half, but it would provide little solace. KRÜ continued their smashmouth style as Leviatán tried to slow things down on their own attack. The floods and aggression from KRÜ were the focal point of the plan on Sunset, as they ran over Leviatán to secure a 13-7 map victory. In 10 full-buy rounds from Leviatán, they managed just four wins. Does Aspas have the best Jett knives in the world? Leviatán would have to keep their playoffs run alive by taking their first ever official game on Abyss. They started off looking right at home, putting aspas back on Jett and getting him the Operator as soon as possible. Five first kills from the duelist in the beginning nine rounds catapulted Leviatán to a 7-1 lead. Mazino 's Harbor utility allowed his squad much space to work with on both their attacking and defending sides, setting them up with a 10-4 lead. But again, strong retakes provided KRÜ an opportunity to get back into the map. A timeout and call to force buy at 11-8 by Itopata supplanted by a Mazino 4K gave Leviatán four chances to close out the map. The resurgence of KRÜ in playoffs coincides with an uptick in mta's play, watch for his form at champs. A 1v1 from Shyy and an impressive 1v3 from mta kept KRÜ alive, but it was another force buy from Leviatán and massive multikill round from aspas that pushed the series to a fifth and final map. Mazino and aspas' fragging combined with timely lurks from C0M and tex were the story of Abyss. Leviatán put together eight half buy rounds, converting seven of them on the way to the victory. Aspas looked much more comfortable on the Jett with his Operator, finding 10 kills with it while floating around the map on defense. Ascent would be the decider, with Leviatán selecting the Cypher-Deadlock composition growing in popularity. An insane tex ace on the bonus round set Leviatán up nicely for a strong attack half. kiNgg 's calling routinely got his squad into sites by utilizing an attack-side operator from aspas and creative ability usage from the Deadlock. tex's highlight reel this year has to be up there with the best. Facing a 8-4 deficit, KRÜ would not go away meekly. On the back of finding their first pistol win since the beginning of Sunset, a 3K from keznit set up a bonus conversion that looked like it could help send the final map down to the wire. But it was KRÜ's aggressive hits that caused them to lose their own footing. On a Leviatán eco round, KRÜ sent it up mid straight into a trap play that enabled a Mazino 3K and a 10-7 lead for Leviatán. Bouncing back was however a theme of the series. A KRÜ eco of and a keznit 1v2 brought the final map to a 10-10 scoreline. Again, forced site hits into Leviatán stacks with both the KAY/O and Killjoy ultimates mowed down KRÜ, allowing Leviatán to close out the map and series on Ascent. aspas had 90 kills in the series, with 71 of them coming in his three Jett maps. The star went a whopping 24-7 in first duels. Mazino was critical in the win, dropping 99 kills across Harbor, Breach, and Deadlock. KRÜ showed great fight in the series, with Shyy in particular having a great showing. Leviatán will play G2 esports in their first Americas final on Sunday to crown the Stage 2 victor. KRÜ will have to wait until the conclusion of that match to see what their draw will look like for the Champions group stage in Seoul."

    "cleaned_content": "FNATIC triumphed over Team Vitality 3-1 in the grand finals of EMEA Stage 2 to be crowned the champions of EMEA. FNATIC has claimed the first regional seed for the group stage of Champions and $100,000 in prize money, while Vitality will be consoled with the second seed and $65,000. “Some teams right now I feel like are a little bit burnt out, and you can kinda see that in their results recently, whereas for us, we're just getting started.” Boaster said in a pre-recorded segment. Boaster's words reflect the results; FNATIC blazed a flawless path through Stage 2 coming into this series, including a comfortable win in the upper bracket final against Vitality days prior. FNATIC sought to secure a second stage championship while Vitality sought to dethrone the kings just as Sayf did with Team Liquid one year ago. For the map veto, FNATIC leveraged their double map ban as the upper bracket finalists to take Icebox and Sunset away from Vitality, the latter of which Vitality beat Team Heretics on twice in the past week. FNATIC chose to open with Haven, where they held a 4-0 record since its return to the pool off the back of their unique Iso and Yoru composition. The duelists were indeed the headliners in the map; Alfajer and Derke took turns dominating Vitality with a combined five multikills. Alfajer barely topped the scoreboard over his fellow duelist with 22 kills and 297 ACS to Derke's 21 kills and 278 ACS. Round 10 was Derke's turn to mow down Vitality. Sayf in particular was unusually quiet, with only 11 kills to 17 deaths. His 1v3 Blade Storm clutch in round 20 came too late to stop his opponents' momentum and FNATIC took the map 13-8. Haven wasn't the last that Vitality saw of the double duelist pairing; FNATIC shocked on their opponent's map pick of Ascent with another Iso and Yoru composition. This gamble did not pay off, as after a few chaotic rounds, Gorilla took a timeout and identified FNATIC's inability to hold the A site without an Omen or a KAY/O to secure Vitality a resounding 8-4 attack half. Vitality carried their momentum forward with a flawless pistol round to secure a 12-5 scoreline. FNATIC attempted to mount a comeback with four consecutive rounds, but Vitality closed out the map 13-9 after Derke failed to clear ceNder out of Wine with his Dimensional Drift ultimate. This time, it was Sayf triumphing in the duelist matchup, racking up 21 kills to 12 deaths and 253 ACS. “In Vitality fashion, we thrive in the chaos,” Sayf said in the comms replay. The hornets' IGL goes unchecked and takes advantage. Unfortunately for Vitality, there was much less chaos to thrive in on FNATIC's pick of Lotus, where neither team changed compositions from the upper final. Kicks and runneR rallied for a moment with a 2v4 in round 10, but Chronicle answered back immediately in round 11 with three kills off of Boaster's Paranoia. In a mirror of Vitality's scoreline on Ascent, FNATIC chained an 8-4 half and a pistol into a 12-5 score, staving off a Vitality comeback attempt to take the map 13-9. The rookie talents of Vitality fight back. Last up was Bind, where FNATIC brought out a Clove pick from Alfajer in place of Boaster's usual Brimstone. Unlike Ascent, Vitality were unable to find a weakness in FNATIC's defense; FNATIC steamrolled the first half, winning the first 10 rounds in a row with significant value from Alfajer's post-death smokes and concluding the match with a commanding 13-3 score. Boaster demonstrated a statement fragging IGL performance on Viper with 18 kills and 320 ACS over 16 rounds. Boaster is indeed in the Lamps. With this victory, FNATIC cement themselves as back-to-back EMEA stage winners and a strong candidate to make a deep run at Champions. When asked who they wanted to face most in Seoul, almost every member of the team answered Gen.G . “I need to get revenge against Gen.G, and I just need to get my revenge in general on the world for doubting FNATIC,” said Boaster. FNATIC and Vitality will return in the group stage of Champions, which begins Aug. 1."

The ninth match between the two organizations, EDward Gaming had come out on top on six different occasions. It is also the fourth best-of-five series between these two teams, with EDG boasting a flawless record in past encounters. FPX started Sunset on the defense, where they won the opening round. They lost the follow up after EDG found the first kill, and ZmjjKK 's Neon helped secure the next two rounds.

The map continued with a back-and-forth, but the defenders were unable to stabilize their economy, awarding FPX with a ninth round. EDG's lead was too much to overcome, as they forced AAAAY into a 1v4 situation to earn match point. The final round went the defender's way, as Smoggy stopped a desperation mid-to-B push with 20 seconds remaining. Heading into their own map choice, FPX maintained their agent composition, with every player on a comfort pick. They went three for three on pistol rounds, but were able to shut down their rival's buy round, taking a 4-0 lead. The disadvantage led to an EDG timeout and eventual round win, switching to a B push and stopping the retake in its tracks. Despite their success on B, EDG returned to A the next three rounds, gifting FPX a 6-2 lead. Momentum shifted in the offense's favor, as they were able to string together four rounds, but a successful retake consolidated FPX's lead by halftime. The fourth half of the series broke FPX's pistol round streak, as Smoggy eliminated the final player with enough time for a 0.04 second defuse. The win helped his team equalize, but they lost the next two rounds despite considerable economic damage. Life breaks EDG's eco with 8 hp clutch Feast and famine followed for EDG, as ZmjjKK helped recover a round after a second failed aggression from Smoggy. Keeping EDG out of the match, Life won a 1v1, breaking their economy. The low buy helped FPX reach map point, and a well-oiled mid push tied the series 1-1. EDward Gaming had the upper-hand on map three, winning four of the first five rounds of Haven. FPX's timeout gave the team temporary respite, but a successful A take was followed up by a hectic EDG win. By 7-2, the offense's second timeout was used. BerLIN and Lysoar won the subsequent eco round, but EDG maintained their footing throughout the rest of the half. After the break, EDward all but brute forced a pistol round win. FPX were able to secure three more rounds, a pause called for the attackers afterwards. EDG reached map point by finishing the round with an aggressive C take, catching their opponents off-guard. A massive blunder from EDG let FPX win their seventh round, but the advantage was too large to overcome. EDward Gaming ended Haven 13-7. During the map, FPX gained a player advantage on 14 of the 20 rounds played. Life and autumn contributed to 11 of those first eliminations, but the team was unable to capitalize on the benefit. Starting on the attack, EDward Gaming won the opening rounds on Icebox. A 4K and clutch from AAAAY helped FPX take the lead in the half, quickly tied by EDG after a timeout and thrifty win. EDG punished an advanced A defense to win the next round, which set them up to win the half 7-5. AAAAY wins a 1v3 The pistol round and a 2v4 secured the lead for FPX. At 8-7, CHICHOO eliminated four before dying to leave a 1v1, but Smoggy could not seal the round. FPX continued extending their lead after heroics from Life and Lysoar, who each found a 3K that all but won the round. ZmjjKK prevented match point with an opening elimination and 1v1, while CHICHOO kept his team in the game by reaching 12-9, but they were only prolonging the inevitable. FunPlus Phoenix sealed the deal with a fairly standard round on B, not needing to plant as they won map four 13-9. EDG opened up the decider, Bind, in dominant fashion. They steamrolled FPX, going up 6-0 on their offense. Their opponent's first round came off the back of a low buy, but EDG continued taking rounds afterwards, reaching 10-2 by the break. ZmjjKK gets his ace Only needing three rounds to win the tournament, EDG appeared to make quick work of their rivals. They stopped FPX's first two attempts into B, reaching their twelfth point of the map. Not content with a stomp on the final map, FunPlus Phoenix started mounting a comeback, winning aim duels and expertly working the map to win their own six-round streak. Relative to the previous rounds in the half, round 21 was anti-climatic. The teams were set up for a clash on B, with EDG on a half buy and FPX having found success on the site in past rounds. BerLIN managed to get three, but three Stinger kills and a Sheriff elimination from EDG put the BerLIN in a must-win 1v2, but the need to plant and incoming Nightfall let ZmjjKK end the series with his classic. The win locks EDG in as the top China seed for Champions Seoul, while FPX will take second seed in the event. It is also EDward's eighth domestic grand final victory in a row, a streak that goes back to FGC Act 2 in 2023."

Paper Rex, now eliminated from playoffs, will take the third seed at Champions Seoul . This series was the ninth encounter between both organizations, with the last six times going Paper Rex's way. The only previous best-of-five was the Pacific 2023 grand final , which Paper Rex took 3-2. Now, usurped by Gen.G, the teams met again - not for the title, but for an opportunity at facing the new Pacific leaders. DRX picked Abyss as the opening map, but it was Paper Rex, who started on offense, that surprised with their agent picks. They opted for a Neon-Phoenix double-duelist, with something on Breach. A fake helped win the pistol round, but Paper Rex were punished for their early Operator purchase after it was picked up and led to BuZz helping win the next two rounds. Flashback had the first of five aces in the series An eco round and two 1v1s gave Paper Rex the lead, but the South Korean squad tied the score again with a clutch of their own, sending the series to halftime at 6-6. Despite their composition being well suited for early aggression and crunches, Paper Rex began the second half with a more orthodox defense. This approach, along with a something ace, helped the team win four rounds in a row. It wasn't until round 13 in which they attempted a more proactive early round, but DRX were able to prevent a stuck defuse to take the point. In the end, Paper Rex closed out their opponent's map 13-7, better able to take advantage of their agents by complimenting aggression with quick rotations and well-coordinated retakes. Paper Rex continued defending in map two, Lotus. They opened the map with two round wins, but DRX took the lead after a Flashback 1v2. A fourth round for the offense prompted a tactical pause from Paper Rex. Triple kills from f0rsakeN and mindfreak forced DRX's own timeout. They were able to score their fifth point, but Paper Rex prevented their opponents from gaining an advantage, ending the first half 7-5. something kept the momentum going with a 1v2 During the second half, DRX's defense took the lead after Paper Rex failed a forcebuy. Once their economy recovered, however, the South East Asian roster won the next four rounds. Back-to-back Jinggg aces and a something clutch took their team to map point. A stuck defuse gave DRX their tenth point by a matter of milliseconds, but it was merely a consolation round. BeYN was left in an unwinnable 1v2 for the final round, and Paper Rex closed out the second map 13-10. One map away from a Paper Rex victory, the series returned to a DRX map, Bind. Flashback found three on the pistol to secure the early lead. The offense went B for four-straight rounds, but were only able to win against DRX's bonus due to a gun advantage. Unrelenting, PRX continued going B after a timeout, losing the next two rounds. Round seven was a change of scenery, as the opening engagement took place in showers. The South Korean team's lead continued to grow, reaching 7-1 before PRX were able to put another round on the board.

The attackers won another two rounds, but a thrifty win put DRX on pace to take the map and tie the series 2-2. Flashback was by far the most impactful player on Icebox, with four clutches and 23 eliminations contributing to his 1.51 rating. The decider map, Ascent, began with a pair of DRX wins. A Paper Rex mid push weakened the attackers enough to secure round three, but DRX continued to extend their lead. By the time Paper Rex were able to win rounds, the offense had separated themselves enough to end the half 7-5. Even though they won the first two rounds of the half, DRX called for a timeout after 9-6. Paper Rex picked up the pace the following round, earning their seventh point of the map. BuZz's Op double kill helped the team ignore forsakeN's reckoning and d4v4i's own multikill, reaching double digits. PRX tried at the other side of the map, but were completely halted, as DRX won and eleventh round, triggering a timeout for the South East Asian squad. BuZz and MaKo sealed the last two rounds, sending their team to the final The pause was unfruitful, as DRX's veterans frustrated another A take by Paper Rex. Paper Rex returned to the same site via mid, only to be stopped by BuZz and MaKo once more. The win confirmed a South Korean victor for the 2024 VCT Pacific season, as DRX will now face Gen.G in the grand final. It is also DRX's first win against Paper Rex since April 2023, as well as revenge for Paper Rex's reverse sweep at the VCT Pacific 2023 grand final.

KRÜ are the final team to qualify for Champions 2024 and have capitalized upon their impressive first-stage performance, despite their 1-3 record in the Stage 2 regular season . Newcomer mta was a key element in securing the win for KRÜ, saving the series with late-game moments on Ascent. 100 Thieves just missed out on Champions 2024 after a fourth-place finish in Stage Two and losing the tiebreaker in Champions points to Sentinels . Despite the loss, eeiu and Cryocells continued a streak of impressive form from Masters Shanghai and Stage 2. The map veto initially seemed to favor 100 Thieves with Ascent as the decider following Icebox and Lotus. Ascent had been the American team's best map in 2024 by win rate at 71% and with notable wins over Sentinels, LOUD , and G2 Esports . In contrast, Ascent had been KRÜ's worst map by win rate at just 17%. A clutch from Melser boosted KRÜ's hopes early on. A 1v2 from eeiu in the pistol kicked off an explosive start on Icebox for 100 Thieves. Despite occasionally struggling to manage the time in the round, 100 Thieves looked in control with a 4-2 lead. KRÜ could thank Melser for landing an instant flick in a 1v2 to cut down their opponent's momentum and force 100T onto an eco. The individuals were evenly matched in the first half with Cryo and keznit trading impact kills to ensure a 6-6 scoreline. keznit provided further impact with a 3K in the second pistol to give KRÜ a buffer against 100T's habit of putting an Operator on Cryo as fast as possible. Although KRÜ managed to deal with Cryo, it was a 2v4 from Asuna and eeiu that put 100T back in the driver's seat at 9-8. KRÜ followed up with just a single round for the rest of the half as the site duos of Cryo and bang on B and Asuna and eeiu on A played off each other perfectly to secure the first map 13-9. Cryo's Operator dominated the field with eight multikill rounds and a 78% first engagement win rate. The American Jett's 27 kills and 324 ACS lit up the server as 100T cruised on the defense. “Once we got to defense we had a lot of confidence and knew that [KRÜ] are not that great with their util,” said 100 Thieves coach Zikz after the first map. Cryo's Op is often the linchpin of 100T's game plan. KRÜ got off to a much better start on Lotus with a pistol and back-and-forth rounds on the generally less favorable defensive side. 100T immediately responded to a KRU thrifty with a thrifty of their own. Boostio 's lurks frequently found impact in slower rounds while KRÜ relied on some excellent shooting from heat combined with set plays. A heroic 3K from eeiu in a 3v5 kept the half even at another 6-6 scoreline. Shyy activated in the second half. Streaks of three rounds each were traded after another KRÜ pistol. Shyy 's performance skyrocketed in the second half with late-game multikills while the trio of bang, Cryo, and Boostio forced out every round of regulation. Ultimately it was the savior plays from Shyy that made the difference as KRÜ narrowly closed out the win 13-11 to tie up the series. heat and Shyy took turns putting their team on their backs in each half with heat taking 16 kills in the first and Shyy taking 17 in the second. Shyy put up 300 ACS and 25 kills to close the map. KRÜ also benefited greatly from a slight advantage in first engagements with 56% win rate. Shyy's late-game impact made him the MVP on Lotus. 100 Thieves came back in full force on Ascent by taking four rounds straight after losing the first gun round to gain a 6-4 lead. KRÜ was largely nullifying Cryo's Operator but Asuna and eeiu provided enough map-wide pressure to carry 100 Thieves across the line in the later stages of rounds. Some late-half exploitation of the A site gifted KRÜ the final two rounds of the half to keep the deficit close at 7-5 for 100 Thieves. A massive 1v3 from eeiu cancelled out a KRÜ pistol to maintain his team's two-round lead at 9-7 and force out KRÜ's final timeout. 100 Thieves responded with another clutch, this time a 1v2 from Boostio. A pivotal 4K from mta at 7-11 down gave KRÜ stability to regain control of the game. Another mta multikill in the following round forced 100 Thieves down to a low buy and made it a one-round game at 11-10 for 100T. KRÜ were insistent on keeping heavy stacks towards the A site and the calls from Melser proved to be on point to even up Ascent 11-11 and force out a final timeout from Zikz. A 1v1 from keznit over eeiu followed to put KRÜ on series point at 12-11. A missed KAY/O molly from Asuna to break Shyy's Killjoy ult sealed the game as KRÜ took the series 2-1 with a 13-11 on Ascent. mta's impact in the final rounds of Ascent could not be understated, with the newcomer bringing in multikills and impactful utility to close out the game on top of having a team-high of 19 kills. KRÜ qualify for Champions 2024. KRÜ are the final team to qualify for Champions 2024 and will face off against LEVIATÁN in the lower bracket final tomorrow. 100 Thieves have been eliminated from VCT Americas Stage 2 and Champions contention."

Both teams had significant winning streaks in Stage 2, with Leviatán not losing a single map while G2 went undefeated. One of these top two Americas teams had to lose, and it was the ever-rising Ascension team that sent Leviatán to the lower finals. Icebox began with G2 winning the pistol, with aspas and his Operator proving to be their biggest challenge as the half went on. Avoiding aspas was a simple and effective strategy. When G2 planted the spike, their no-duelist-Gekko comp made retakes and defuses nearly impossible for Leviatán. valyn 's calling on attack side was beautiful, as he pulled rotations and cleared space for his team to secure free spike plants. G2 entered the half up 10-2 by dismantling a defense that Leviatán had looked outstanding on throughout playoffs. The second pistol round went in G2's favor, but Leviatán won their force buy to stop the bleeding. But the deficit proved to be too big of a mountain to climb back from, as G2 won the map 13-8. JonahP was the star of the show with 21 kills and 10 assists. Like in his previous game against 100 Thieves , he single-handedly won multiple rounds for G2 to win Icebox. Bind brought about two double-initiator comps, but G2 ran Skye while Leviatán chose Fade. G2 continued their pistol-round dominance and converted their bonus to threaten another first-half steamroll. Leviatán won a needed thrifty to keep the map within their grasp, but G2 kept their foot on the gas with a nice Gekko-Brimstone ultimate combo to end their attack half 8-4. trent and valyn combo their ultimate for two free kills. Leviatán won their first pistol round of the series on their attack half, but after G2 won their bonus they continued to position themselves in the right spots on defense. Constant flanks from JonahP and leaf caused plenty of issues for Leviatán, and what seemed like a close map slipped away. valyn sounded the death knell by winning a defuse clutch with the Classic. valyn clutches a 1v2 on Bind with nearly no time left. G2 ended the map 13-6 and the series 2-0, marking the first time Leviatán had been swept in VCT 2024. Now, they will have to take that hit to the chin and stand back up again in the lower bracket finals against the winner of 100 Thieves and KRÜ Esports. As for G2, they can rest easy and wait for their opponents in the regional finals , knowing they have a good chance at both the trophy and the top seed for the Americas."

Team Heretics are eliminated from the playoffs, with this loss locking them in the third seed for EMEA at Champions 2024. This was the first best-of-five series in 2024 for Team Vitality, their deep map pool allowing them to shine against an experienced Team Heretics squad. The series began on Icebox, with both teams running their variation of the Gekko-Sova-double-initiator comp. Heretics put MiniBoo on his signature Neon, while Vitality kept their star duelist Sayf on Jett. On defense, the Relay Bolts from MiniBoo prevented any set plays from Sayf. RieNs was also significantly winning in the Sova duel, as Heretics entered their attack half up 9-3. RieNs wins a low health 1v1 thanks to his ultimate. Vitality needed an impactful defense half, and a pistol win into a bonus conversion offered some hope. However, those were the only defense rounds Vitality won. MiniBoo frequently pushed into enemy spawn through B site to catch Vitality off guard, helping secure a 13-6 map win for Heretics. The duelist matchup then shifted to Neon versus Neon as both teams opted for the Sunset comp that Team Heretics introduced back in Kickoff. Vitality stole a pistol round thanks to a sneaky defuse, then converted their bonus to end their defense half up 8-4. The two Neons drew a lot of attention, but the Cypher of runneR was the star with 16 kills at the half. runneR continued to frag on the attack as Vitality built a significant lead and never relented, winning Sunset 13-4 and tying the series. Lotus was a return of double initiator, as both teams ran Breach and Fade. MiniBoo stayed on Neon, while Sayf moved to Raze. It was his third duelist agent in three maps, and he started Lotus on fire with back-to-back 4Ks. Sayf built Showstopper twice in the first six rounds and ended his defense half with 22 kills. Vitality moved to their attack side up 9-3 and ended their attack perfectly to end the map 13-3 and take the series lead. Moving to Haven, Vitality maintained their form from Lotus. Vitality had another 8-4 lead at the half, but Heretics fought back to take their first pistol-round win since the beginning of the series on Icebox. Even as RieNs and MiniBoo tried to claw their way back in the game, Vitality answered with a stalwart defense thanks to Kicks and runneR. The map ended 13-9, and Vitality won their debut best-of-five match to face Fnatic in the regional finals. Team Vitality secure Haven and win the series 3-1. For Sayf, this is an earned return to a regional final. He did so with Team Liquid in 2023, and now he has the chance to beat Fnatic and steal the regional title once again in 2024. Sayf's outstanding performance alongside runneR's transition to Sentinel have paid dividends for Vitality, as they now know they will be a top-two regional seed heading to Seoul. Vitality will face Fnatic on July 20 for the trophy and the top seed at Champions 2024."

    "cleaned_content": "FunPlus Phoenix have made their third VCT China final of the year after reverse sweeping Trace Esports in a 3-2 victory. The BerLIN -led squad move on to play EDward Gaming in the grand finals. Despite impressing at Masters Shanghai, FPX failed to carry this success into the domestic scene with the squad recording six series losses throughout stage 2. Two of those losses have come at the hands of Trace. In contrast, Trace have only improved over the year and qualified for their first ever international event in Champions 2024 after being a single series away from qualifying for both previous Masters events. Kai and FengF have proven themselves as a formidable duo atop the Chinese scene comparable to EDG's ZmjjKK and Smoggy . Kai fought back FPX in their bonus. The series kicked off on Lotus, FPX's first pick. Trace's individuals quickly brought the heat into the series with a 3K from LuoK1ng to take the pistol followed by a hero 4K 1v2 clutch from Kai to take away FPX's bonus. FPX continued to opt into a triple controller composition featuring no Sentinel and Trace's attack revolved around exploiting this weakness. Back-to-back multikill rounds from Life brought some momentum back into FPX's sails and forced Trace down to an eco to cut the lead to 5-3. LuoK1ng responded by singlehandedly opening up the A site with a 3K and closing out the round with an ace. The former TYLOO player has continued to impress for a Trace that has struggled to put extra firepower behind the stars of FengF and Kai. The half was closed by a 1v1 clutch from heybay that provided Trace a brief lead heading into the second half at 7-5. FPX's comp truly blossomed on the attack with the post-plant strengths of Astra and Viper coming into play. With Life now fully online Trace called their final timeout at 11-10 and destroyeR 's words provided the support Trace needed to close out the map 13-11 after a 1v1 defuse clutch from heybay. The duo of Kai and LuoK1ng excelled on Lotus with 273 and 197 ACS respectively. Kai's aggressive Sentinel play continued to provide dividends for his team with a 100% first engagement win rate at 3-0. Despite the pair being the only Trace players to end the map with a positive K/D, both Biank and heybay provided high-impact kills and clutches that were vital to closing out the map in regulation. LuoK1ng was a monster for his team on Lotus. Trace once again excelled in the early rounds after moving onto Ascent with six straight before their opponents could respond. FPX once again opted not to run a Sentinel and instead inserted BerLIN's Astra into the standard meta composition. Following a timeout, FPX incorporated a significant amount of aggression into their defense which Trace struggled to deal with. An attacking Operator on Kai did little to quell impressive performances from AAAAY , Life, and Autumn as FPX accrued six straight rounds of their own to close the half at 6-6. The second half was chaotic to start as a fourth pistol was gifted to Trace thanks to a 4K from Kai before clutches were traded by Biank and BerLIN. Once the funds were available for Trace the game began to stabilize with the Operator and Odin on Kai and Biank allowing for standard defensive setups to excel. Trace fought past their initial hiccups to close out the second map 13-8 and put themselves on series point with a 2-0 lead. Kai continued to dominate with 26 kills and 187 ADR on Jett. This time around it was Biank who joined Kai atop the scoreboard for Trace with the pair being the only two Trace players to record above 150 ADR. Biank has had a multitude of high-impact moments for Trace. Abyss followed and Trace looked entirely out of their element in the early rounds. The new map acted as a playground for FPX's signature unique compositions and style with the first Fade pick on Abyss in VCT from AAAAY. Lysoar 's Cypher went unanswered by the attackers as FPX cruised to a 6-0 lead. After using both timeouts Trace managed to recover the deficit by shifting their focus away from the A site to keep FPX's lead close at 7-5 before the end of the half. Another FPX pistol all but secured the map win as a 9-5 lead was too much for Trace to overcome. FPX's defaults and executes looked much more prepared compared to Trace's and there was a clear game plan being carried out in every round. Life's Yoru ran over the defenses and a 1v2 from Autumn in round 20 put FPX on match point at 12-8. A quick B execute followed and FPX cleaned up the map 13-8 to keep their finals dreams alive. Life's entry Yoru excelled at exploiting the weaknesses in a Trace that were inexperienced on the new terrain with 21 kills and 198 ADR. On the defense, it was Lysoar's Cypher who dominated the sites with varied setups that were impossible for Trace to counter. Lysoar's Cypher exploited Trace's lack of experience on the new map. Trace debuted a brand new Deadlock composition on Bind and made use of several different GravNet set-plays that caught FPX off guard. Despite being at frequent man-disadvantages, FPX were able to rely on their individuals to drag them to round wins. Life and Lysoar pulled out multiple miracle multikills to save FPX and keep the first half close at 6-6. FPX turned the game around on the attack with six rounds straight after losing the pistol to reach map point at 12-8. Trace mustered up just a single round before FPX closed the map out at 13-9 and tied the series at 2-2. Trace's individuals started to cool off come the later rounds and the more experienced team won out. Lysoar made up for a weaker performance from Life with 25 kills and 297 ACS on Brimstone. FPX also benefited greatly from a 64% opening engagement win rate. Haven was left as map five and FPX carried their momentum to victory. Back and forth rounds proceeded a Trace pistol including a 1v2 from Autumn, 1v1 from BerLIN, and absurd defuse 1v2 from Life. A solid hold from Lysoar and Autumn on the C site allowed FPX to tie up the score at 4-4. Trace could rely on a superb performance from Kai with a 20-8 K/D in the first half to ensure a 6-6 scoreline. Trace fumbled a pivotal 2v1. Trace appeared fully dejected come the end of the series as FPX overwhelmed sites with their unique combination of Breach and KAY/O utility. FPX dominated the attack side of the map with six of eight rounds in the final half. Their individuals refused to give up and manifested the reverse sweep with four clutches in the final map as AAAAY closed out the series at 12-8 up with a 1v2 to steal the series 3-2. Despite losing the map, Kai's 28 kills topped the server as his Operator provided significant value in both halves. FPX could thank AAAAY for an excellent late-game performance on Breach, putting up a team-high 21 kills and the game-winning 1v2 clutch. FPX's winning moment. FPX will face off against EDG in their third VCT China final of the year tomorrow. Trace have been eliminated from the VCT China Stage 2 playoffs but will continue to ply their trade at Champions 2024 in August."

The victory means Sentinels have qualified to Champions Seoul via championship points, as Leviatán will take a higher seed in the event. Both Leviatán and KRÜ await the result of the second match of the day, G2 Esports vs. 100 Thieves , to determine their next opponent. This series is the 13th time the premier Latin American teams have played each other in non-best-of-one matches, with six victories apiece in previous encounters. Prior to this match, Leviatán had won the three most recent series, while the last time KRÜ took the win was twice in the 2023 Last Chance Qualifier. Icebox was selected to start the series, while KRÜ decided to go with Sunset as their map. KRÜ would start on attack on both maps. If KRÜ was able to end Leviatán's map streak, Haven remained as the decider map. Leviatán had a strong start, shutting down every attempt made by the offense. KRÜ's first round came after an Atom timeout, a double fake and Melser 4K catching Leviatán off guard. KRÜ were unable to shift the momentum back, however, as kiNgg and aspas each won a 1v1 and took over the remainder of the half. Shyy gets a sneaky 3K, tex gets a more impactful one In the second half, tex found his second pistol-round multikill to put his team up 11-2. The next round also went in their favor, as Leviatán played the clock to perfection and reached match point with a last-second plant. In the end, a clean aspas 4K won them their map with a dominant 13-2. “[We need to] always be one step ahead,” kiNgg said about their success. “We should be aggressive, unpredictable.” After the match, tex also emphasized the need for preparation. “We just need to prepare well, focus, and that's how we keep our confidence.” The beginning of Sunset appeared to mirror map one perfectly. Leviatán won the pistol, took the anti-eco and bonus, and a tex clutch forced a KRÜ timeout after 4-0. The tactical pause was not as effective as the first time, as Leviatán won a 2v2 and were unfazed by KRÜ's eco round. In round 7 an early C0M Hunter's Fury found heat and gave his team a player advantage. KRÜ played a slow round to find two eliminations and plant on A. Despite a double kill from tex, Melser won the clutch and put his team on the board. C0M and Mazino spraydown Leviatán quickly recovered the following round to break KRÜ's economy. keznit was able to buy a Guardian, which he used to help his team win the eco round after a mid pick and pivot to A. The next three rounds went in the defender's favor, going to half time with another 10-2 scoreline. The second pistol round went KRÜ's way, and they were able to win the anti-eco despite considerable damage from the rival squad. This meant they went into the bonus round with only two Guardians and three Sheriffs, a buy too weak to stop Leviatán's attack. KRÜ had full firepower the next round, but a surprising entry from aspas left A open, with his team cleaning up with an aggressive post-plant. Forced onto an eco, KRÜ were helpless during the final round, and Leviatán took advantage with a quick mid push to seal the series. “I expected a 2-1,” kiNgg said regarding the matchup. “I know the guys, they're insane.” He mentioned feeling comfortable today against KRÜ. “I don't know why, it always felt like we were peeking 3v1.” The victory means Leviatán have won their sixth match in a row, and extends their map winstreak to 12. The win also means aspas is two series away from a second VCT Americas title, having won the 2023 season with his previous team, LOUD. KRÜ remain in the tournament, descending to the lower bracket. They maintain their hopes of qualifying to Champions, needing to win their next series against either G2 Esports or 100 Thieves . Should they be successful, they will make the top-three in VCT Americas and join FNATIC as the only teams to attend every single Champions event."

FPX took a dominant 2-0 back in May, losing just eight rounds across both maps, raising the expectations for themselves coming into this lower bracket match. History quickly seemed to be repeating itself, as FPX kicked off the match by way of a 13-3 on their opponents' Ascent pick. All they would have to do now is close it out on Icebox, their pick. But BLG fought back, and they fought hard. FPX refused to let their opponents down easy, but BLG managed to score a 14-12 overtime win. Flex1n closed out the map with a 4K and topped the charts overall, scoring the highest ACS and ADR and tying for the most kills with opponent AAAAY . Lotus was also a close affair, as the pendulum of momentum swung from one side to the other. The late game belonged to FPX, though, and they eventually reached a 13-10 win that put an end to the match. Flex1n had B on lockdown. Autumn and Life were a step above the rest of the server, accruing 121 kills (30 openers) between them throughout the three maps, more than half of all of BLG put together. The former also topped the charts in ADR and ACS, where he averaged 174 and 270, respectively. Today was not the day for Bilibili, who are now on a three-match loss streak against BerliN's squad. Their last win against FPX was July 15 of last year in the lower bracket of the China Champions qualifier . They had to go the distance to beat FPX back then, but struggled to repeat that feat today.

EDG won both pistol rounds and converted their defense-side bonus to win map one exceptionally, 13-2. Since the playoffs began, EDG have run the Team Heretics Neon composition on Sunset to much success. Abyss was next up in the series, making its debut in the Chinese region, and ZmjjKK surprised everyone by picking Yoru. EDG ran double duelist against the double smokes from Trace. Trace started their attack by utilizing their smokes to facilitate post-plants. EDG then won their defensive rounds off of their superior aim and trademark aggression. Smoggy goes down with his ship. Smoggy had multiple highlights across the EDG defense, as he was able to play more loosely when he moved from Omen to Jett. Bolstered by a strong Yoru from ZmjjKK, EDG entered the half up 7-5. After winning the second pistol round on Abyss, EDG mirrored their second half on Sunset and were perfect to close out the map 13-5. It was a quick and easy win for EDG, even with ZmjKK playing Neon and Yoru instead of his standard Jett and Raze. His 39 kills, 11 first kills, and 327 ACS led both teams as EDG walked their way into the finals. This win locks EDG into the first or second seed heading into Champions 2024.

The LATAM squad came out on top 2-1 and began their run for Champions, while Cloud9 were eliminated from contention. The map vetoes saw Cloud9 banning Ascent and Sunset, while KRÜ banned Bind and Icebox, the latter being one of the maps where KRÜ bested C9 just a week earlier. The series began with Cloud9's pick of Abyss, Valorant's newest map. Cloud9 opened the game with a pistol round win, but KRÜ turned the tide as they locked up five out of six rounds, giving them an early 6-2 lead. vanity 's leadership and Operator skills gave C9 the edge and locked up the four remaining rounds to tie at 6-6. The second half was a brawl as both teams traded round after round, each inching their scoreline closer to 13. Cloud9 seemed close to winning round 18 and tying the game, but a phenomenal clutch and a 0.1-second defuse from heat gave KRÜ the momentum to get to an 11-8 lead. While Cloud9 tied the map at 11-11, the LATAM squad took the first map at 13-11. The Brazilian ace topped the charts with 26 kills and 15 assists, the most out of anyone in both categories. Too close. Way too close. While the second map of Lotus was KRÜ's pick, it was Cloud9 that opened up the map with a devastating 11-1 first half, as runi 's surprise Clove pick meddled with the LATAM squad. Only heat's three-piece on round 9 was enough to stop C9's assault. KRÜ opened the second half with wins on the pistol and anti-eco, but their losses continued to pile up and soon they were facing defeat at 12-3. Round 16 began KRÜ's Herculean effort to bring it to overtime, with the team fighting tooth and nail to stay alive. keznit 's heroic 1v2 clutch gave his team one more chance to tie the series. However, OXY 's 3k at A site put an end to KRÜ's comeback. Despite losing the map, heat once again outperformed the rest of the server, being the highest-rated player and having 25 kills this time. Meanwhile, keznit's Raze matched evenly with OXY's as both players had 21 kills each. Nails were bit at this moment. The decider saw the return of one of Valorant's classic maps, Haven. KRÜ and C9 both had similar comps, with Neon being the pick for keznit instead of Jett. The change in duelists proved fatal for C9 as KRÜ's electrifying pace and aggression gave them a 9-3 lead in the first half. Even the early pistol and anti-eco round wins weren't enough for C9 to make a comeback. From there, they managed just one more round before they were defeated 13-6, ending their season. Only C9's moose remained the positive KDA player with 205 ACS and 15 kills. The rest of Cloud9 were outmatched by their counterparts. heat had Cloud9's number all game long, as he had a +29 K/D differential and a 65-36-32 KDR.

    "cleaned_content": "Team Heretics defeated FUT Esports 2-0 in the lower round of the EMEA Stage 2 playoffs and have advanced to the lower bracket final against Team Vitality . FUT have been eliminated from playoffs and will represent EMEA as the region's fourth seed at Champions via circuit points. This result comes as a disappointment for the Turkish squad considering their entrance into the playoffs as the first seed with an 8-2 record in the regular season. Coming into this match, Heretics held a dominant 8-0 map record against FUT in 2024. Both teams' losses in the upper semifinals raised the question of which team would bounce back first on FUT's map pick of Abyss, the map's first appearance in VCT EMEA. Los Niños kicked off the first half of Abyss with a 6-1 score by dominating the sites on attack, but FUT brought it back to 6-6 after a timeout from Gais . The second half was a back and forth clash that culminated in a 13-10 victory for Heretics off the back of multiple close retakes. While no one player took over the server, RieNs and Wo0t distinguished themselves with a combined 33 assists and respective ratings of 1.39 and 1.26, reflecting strong teamplay from the side of Heretics. “We just played our game, played our strats, and we won. That's all,” Wo0t said of Abyss in the post-match interview. For the second map, Heretics selected their home field of Sunset despite suffering their first loss on the map in months the day before. The map opened with yet another clutch-filled 6-6 first half, where Boo 's impressive 1v2 against yetujey and AtaKaptan in round 8 was almost immediately countered by a 4K from yetujey in round 10. Can this guy's Outlaw be stopped? Both duelists spearheaded aggressive plays for their teams throughout the map, but it was often the support players who made the difference. AtaKaptan was in strong form, with 23 kills and 280 ACS on Omen, but Boo's three clutches took Heretics over the line. RieNs continued to serve the team reliably with 17 kills, topping the scoreboard for the series with a 1.26 overall rating. Sunset remained on a razor's edge until the very end; Heretics managed to avoid overtime in the final round by sending MiniBoo 's Neon Overdrive ultimate through top mid to catch FUT's defenders off-guard. A creative overwhelm on the A site nets Heretics another win on their home map. Heretics' victory sets up an early rematch between them and Vitality, the team that beat Heretics on Sunset and sent them to the lower bracket just a day ago. “I think it's good to lose because we can learn about how other teams counter us,” Wo0t said of yesterday's loss. “We just learn what's our mistakes, what's our gaps, so we just try to fix it.” Heretics will find out if their fixes can make the difference against Team Vitality on Friday, July 19 at 6 p.m. CEST as they battle for glory and a higher seed at Champions. The victor will earn the right to challenge FNATIC in the grand final on Saturday."

    "cleaned_content": "The VCT EMEA Stage 2 playoffs upper final saw FNATIC face Team Vitality . Both teams had fought their way through the elimination stage of the tournament. The stakes were high, with FNATIC confirming a berth in the grand final post-win. The map veto saw Fnatic opt for Lotus, a staple in their pool. They continued to let Sunset through the bans, a map Vitality quickly locked in given their win on the map over Team Heretics yesterday. The decider of the series was Ascent. Vitality found a brilliant start on Lotus, their opponent's pick. On the attack, they won the first five rounds convincingly, until FNATIC won a round by running Vitality down on the timer. This let them recover, winning the next three rounds with the help of an Odin and even an Operator on Derke . Both teams netted one more round apiece to end in a 7-5 half in favor of Vitality. Odin + Op = a bad, bad time. Unfortunately, Vitality's first half momentum had been sandbagged by FNATIC's explosive attacking side, bolstered by Derke. FNATIC converted a flawless full buy round after losing the pistol and anti-eco, followed by another win off of a 3K from Derke to narrow the score to 9-7. Despite a thrifty win to bring the score to 11-9, FNATIC maintained their pace and won the next four rounds to take the map 13-11. Derke was FNATIC's hero on this map with 25 kills, six first kills, and a +10 kill differential. Vitality's pick of Sunset, following Sayf 's pop-offs on Neon in previous games, was up next. While FNATIC had a flawless record on the map so far this stage, they had played it only twice. Vitality won the pistol again, but after FNATIC stole away the anti-eco with just classics, the team collapsed. FNATIC won six more rounds to get to 8-1 before Vitality punched back with a round off a 3K from Sayf, but the damage had been done. The half culminated in a 9-3 scoreline in favor of FNATIC. FNATIC's retakes looked impeccable. Vitality won their fourth pistol of the day and the following round to narrow the scoreline to 9-5, but once again, rifles allowed FNATIC to secure the next two rounds. Boaster in particular showcased the potential of the Astra in the post-plant, as well as being able to use his own smokes to find crucial kills in both rounds. Vitality won one more round to bring the score to 11-6, but FNATIC could feel the win. They took the map 13-6, winning their final round with another explosive 4K from Derke. Welcome back to the grand finals, FNATIC. While Vitality's Sayf had the highest damage with 277 ACS and the most kills on the server, three of FNATIC's players crossed the 200 ACS threshold – Derke, Chronicle , and rookie hiro – while none of the remainder of Vitality did. FNATIC have qualified for another EMEA grand final with this win. Both teams have qualified to Champions already, along with FUT Esports and Team Heretics , so the fight right now is for a regional title. While FNATIC have multiple under their belt, this would be Vitality's first. Vitality will play the loser of FUT vs. Heretics in the lower final."

    "cleaned_content": "EDward Gaming have moved on to the upper finals at the VCT China Stage 2 playoffs after a 2-1 win that sent Bilibili Gaming to the lower bracket. EDG's win extends their win streak over BLG to eight, with a total map record of 19-3. The only other times the latter were able to steal a map were at last year's VCT Champions China Qualifier and at the world championship about a month later, taking one map in each meeting. Today's performance could have been a display of dominance from the Chinese kings, as they dominated their Sunset pick with a 13-5 win. Knight thought differently though, and found an ace on Bind that spurred BLG on to level the series with a 13-7 and trigger the Lotus decider. EDG quickly returned to form, though, accruing a 9-3 halftime lead on Lotus. Bilibili fought hard to come back into the game, eventually reaching double digits. It was at that moment Smoggy landed a 3K in a retake, enabling his team to close it out thereafter with a 13-10 scoreline. A great contrast between the silent RyanCentral and the excited Chinese casters EDG's Sunset performance is largely owed to ZmjjKK who, despite only downing five more than teammate nobody , put up a +10 differential and eight opening frags, nearly as many as the entire server combined. On Lotus, he combined with nobody and Smoggy for 64 kills, 12 kills shy of matching all of BLG put together. In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death, taxes, and EDward Gaming beating Bilibili Gaming. Going on a year and a half of facing each other — having met eight times since March 2023 — the former have always come out on top. The matchup is an especially rough draw for the latter, who stand on just three map wins to EDG's 19. Conversely, it's a point of consistency for EDG, the perennial kings of China who have never taken their eyes off the ball. Today's win is a step towards yet another regional title. Overall, it would be the 12th Chinese title EDG would be able to add to their trophy case. But it will not be that simple. BLG still have a fighting chance in the lower bracket, where they face FunPlus Phoenix tomorrow . EDG themselves still have to go through at least two matches before they can lift that trophy. EDG return to the server tomorrow to face Trace Esports in the upper final at 7 p.m. China Standard Time."

    "cleaned_content": "Trace Esports advanced to the VCT China upper bracket final after a 2-0 win over FunPlus Phoenix . This victory means Trace broke out of the top-four for the first time this year, a feat they were unable to pull off in Kickoff and Stage 1. Both teams await the result of today's second series, EDward Gaming vs. Bilibili Gaming , to determine their respective opponents for their next match on July 18. The four remaining teams have already qualified to Champions Seoul , which means they are now playing for a chance at a better group in the marquee VCT tournament. Including the pre-partnership era, this match was the seventh time both teams played against each other. In previous encounters, FPX came out on top on four occasions, but Trace had the most recent victory, a 2-1 win in the Stage 2 group stage. Despite the victory and matching FPX's 7-3 regular season record, Trace lost out on a top seed going into playoffs due to a three-way tiebreaker, meaning they were placed in the single-elimination portion of the bracket. During the veto, Sunset and Icebox received the initial bans. Trace chose to open the match on Ascent, while FPX opted for Haven as the second map. Bind and Abyss were banned next, leaving Lotus as the decider map. The veto slightly favored Trace, who had a higher winrate on all three maps across 2024, albeit with fewer maps played than FPX. An early quadruple kill for FengF gave Trace the pistol round, followed by back-to-back triples from Biank and LuoK1ng . A fourth round win forced a timeout from FPX, but they were unable to stop Trace's lead from growing. Biank had earned his fourth multikill of the match before FPX called their final timeout. His Odin found three the following round. During map one, Biank remained unfazed by FPX's offense FPX finally broke through the defense on round ten, and a well coordinated execute gave them their second round of the map. Trace used up one of their timeouts, but a fast-paced push from FPX ended the half 9-3. LuoK1ng helped win the second pistol by recovering from a 3v4 and scoring his own 4K. A quick anti-eco gave Trace their 11th point, and unfavorable engagements from FPX quickly leveled the playing field in Trace's bonus round. In the end, Trace won Ascent 13-3, one map away from the upper final. Biank was by far the standout player of the map, his defense helping his team gain an unreachable lead and setting them up for a quick second half. The classic Sova-Odin pairing earned him a 22/7 KD and 390 ACS. LuoK1ng was also instrumental, with 12 eliminations in the first half and seven in their attacking half, including the final two to win Ascent. Coming into Haven, Trace once again gained an early lead, only losing three rounds in their attack. FengF opened with another 4K, but FPX was quick to answer back after a force buy on round two and the following anti-eco. FengF's early multikills allowed him to use a Lockdown and set up a favorable post-plant, equalizing the scoreline. The attack was unrelenting, ending the half with another 9-3. FengF lead the charge this time with 18 eliminations on Killjoy, and LuoK1ng followed close behind with 15 kills and seven assists. AAAAY continued the trend of pistol-round 4Ks, preventing a fast retake from Trace and helping win a fourth round for his team. BerLIN doubled his eliminations the next round with a Spectre triple kill, but Trace reached double digits the next round, prompting an FPX tactical pause. A BerLIN Stinger round followed, and FPX began closing the gap with another three points. BerLIN swings the momentum in his team's favor Round 21 saw Trace reach match point. Kai was able to win the Operator 1v1 against Life on C, and after minimal exploration, FPX opted to finish the round on the same site. LuoK1ng and Kai were prepared, however, and they flawlessly shut down their opponent's site take. FPX won two more rounds, but were unable to reach overtime. A pair of early kills from Trace in A main gained them the upper hand, and heybay managed to stop FPX's disjointed reagress. This win extends Trace's ongoing winstreak to four victories, and is an opportunity for the team to match their historical best of second place in last year's Valorant Evolution Series . Outside of Act 2 in 2023, the team has only reached the top four at Riot-run events. Now, the only thing between Trace and a grand final appearance is one of EDward Gaming or Bilibili Gaming , who are currently playing on the other side of the bracket. FPX will need to play the remaining team if they want to continue their playoff run and improve their Champions seeding."

The team has a lifeline in the lower bracket, where they will face Team Heretics . The two teams met just a few weeks ago during the group stage of the VCT EMEA, when Heretics bested the Turks 2-0. FNATIC were already comfortable by the time they reached the second half of Haven. After dominating FUT for the past 17 rounds, Alfajer decided to strike down four opponents by himself in a clean 4K that put an end to the match. Stylin' on ‘em. That comfort was a result of Sunset, a map where FUT seemed to be the ones in control, despite dropping five rounds in the final stages of regulation. Those five, alongside rounds FNATIC would steal away — like when Derke blasted four with the Sheriff — let FNATIC trigger an overtime where they won 15-13. The lax gameplay was also a result of Derke , hiro , and Alfajer dominating on Haven, as the three chucked 3Ks and 4Ks around like a hot potato. Between the three, on Haven alone, they added up to 12 multikills; more than all of FUT combined on that map. Alfajer in particular had a stunner Haven. While both teams were largely on even ground during Sunset, FNATIC's young gun flexed his muscles in the second map, which he finished with a +17 differential across 26 kills and 230 ADR. He also clocked in a 1.79 rating and 89% KAST, topping the charts in all of those statistics. The crowd went silent until the 0.01 second defuse was confirmed. After running out of steam on Sunset, FUT seemed to have no answer for FNATIC. It was a stark contrast from the FUT that showed up to 2-1 FNATIC in Shanghai just last month. But that was just the second time FUT had ever beaten FNATIC; it was just one game. Just like this victory may be one game. FUT are down but not out, and will return tomorrow to fight for their lives against Team Heretics. Should they win, a possible rematch against FNATIC — in the lower finals or the grand finals — will still be a reality. For that to happen, though, they must go through Heretics first. FUT return tomorrow at 9 p.m. CEST to fight, now facing elimination for the first time. It's important to remember that both teams have already qualified for Champions, but they still care about regional glory. FNATIC in particular are on their way to a third regional title in EMEA, an unprecedented feat, and are just two matches away from that. Their next opponent is Team Vitality, tomorrow, at 6 p.m. CEST."

This victory finalizes the EMEA points leaderboard, with Vitality coming in fourth, just over Karmine Corp . Their semifinal opponents Heretics, alongside FNATIC and FUT Esports , round out the EMEA convoy heading into Seoul next month. The match almost seemed to go Heretics' way, after they kept Vitality's comeback at bay in map one. The Golden Hornets came back from a 9-3 deficit into overtime, only to lose 14-12 due to stellar plays from Boo in the final rounds of the map. It was Sayf 's Sunset performance that kept Vitality alive in the match, as he carried the team to a 13-10 victory with an ace midway through and a ridiculous slide kill to close out the map, giving Heretics their first loss on the map in 10 matches. New Neon, everybody. Bind closed everything out in favor of the Golden Hornets. The first half was a tightly-contested affair, even despite benjyfishy 's Sheriff ace, but Vitality let a comeback slip through and Heretics reached overtime. There, Kicks dealt the finishing blow in a Gekko 1v1 against RieNs that booked the bees' tickets to Seoul. Sayf felt like the catalyzing force behind Vitality's victory. The Swede put the team on his back with 27 kills, a 1.42 rating, nearly 300 ACS, and eight multikills on Sunset alone. The performance was a step above anyone else's on Icebox and unmatched on Bind, even by himself. His Sheriff isn't clean, it's the cleanest. Vitality's victory marks a new age for the Golden Hornets. Despite debuting on the scene in early 2021, the team has never qualified to a LAN event and have only attended LOCK//IN , where the bees won just a single match. This year wasn't exactly the best for Vitality either up until this point: the team missed the VCT EMEA Stage 1 playoffs, placing last in their group, and failed to reach the playoffs of Kickoff prior to that. Now they are back, in form, and ready to make their international debut. There was no better way for Vitality to end their LAN drought than to qualify for Champions, where a fourth world champion will undecidedly be crowned. But before they can do that, they have to go through the EMEA wringer. Vitality rejoin the server tomorrow, at 6 p.m. CEST, against FUT or FNATIC."

The team has also brought back Domagoj \" doma \" Fancev as a substitute and Martin \" Anderzz \" Schelasin as a strategic consultant ahead of Champions. A critical member of the team since their championship run at LOCK//IN , Leo reported visible health issues in the EMEA Stage 1 playoffs and Masters Shanghai. According to team director Colin \" CoJo \" Johnson , Leo has been on “full rest” since stepping down and has not been involved in the team's preparation. Leo stated that he is “still not in a physical condition to be competing” and encouraged the fans to continue supporting hiro and the rest of the team. CoJo added that the team plans for Leo to return to the starting roster as soon as he recovers. FNATIC picked up hiro from Papara SuperMassive in the Turkish Challengers League as a prospective young talent to fill out the team. Since then, FNATIC have been undefeated in Stage 2 with a 4-0 record in the regular season, serving as a strong comeback from their disappointing 0-2 performance at Masters Shanghai. hiro has been a standout player for FNATIC thus far and currently holds a tenth-place 1.14 overall rating in VCT EMEA. He most recently demonstrated an impressive 30-kill Sunset map to take his team over the line against Karmine Corp in their first match of playoffs . Pending Riot approval, FNATIC have also added two familiar faces. doma has been added as a substitute for Champions and Anderzz has rejoined the team's coaching staff as a strategic consultant. doma played for FNATIC in 2021 and was part of the squad that placed second at Masters Reykjavik . He most recently competed in the Turkish Challengers League as part of Digital Athletics . He will travel to Seoul with the team and will serve as a substitute if needed. Anderzz has been a part of FNATIC three times previously and is notably credited for designing FNATIC's signature Fade team composition on Lotus prior to LOCK//IN, which is still a popular composition on the map over a year later. Anderzz' addition has sparked discussion over whether he has been brought in specifically to provide the team with insight into the new map Abyss. FNATIC have already locked their spot at Champions through circuit points.

    "cleaned_content": "Bilibili Gaming rolled over JDG Esports 2-0 in the first round of the VCT China: Stage 2 playoffs , locking in their spot at this year's Valorant Champions. More than keeping Bilibili alive in the China playoffs, this win also locked the standings leaderboard for the region. EDward Gaming , FunPlus Phoenix , Trace Esports , and Bilibili Gaming will all represent China in South Korea next month. BLG's clean sweep is deceiving, as the team went into the final stretches of regulation on both Sunset and Icebox. The former boiled down to a more consistent effort from Bilibili who, despite not accruing huge round streaks, slowly inched their way to a 13-9 win. Despite the similar 13-7 scoreline, Icebox played out differently as the scoreline was tied at 7-7 shortly after switching sides. Two rounds later, an ace from yosemite at the back of the A site unlocked the game for his side, allowing Bilibili to chain six rounds on their way to victory. Yosemite's ace was far from the only stat making him stand out, as the flex player capped at 328 ACS on Icebox, the highest of the match and the highest of the map by over 100. Teammate whzy had a similar performance on Sunset, albeit while accruing two more kills at 23 and far fewer assists, scoring four on Sunset to Yosemite's 10 on Icebox. Who cares if it's against an eco? With this win, Bilibili maintain their flawless record of Champions attendance, and are the only team to do so alongside EDward Gaming. BLG can finally breathe a sigh of relief this year. After Champions and reaching the VCT last year, the team's road has been full of bumps, as the squad was unable to reach playoffs in both Kickoff and Stage 1 . In Stage 2, the team has gone on a near-flawless run. The only pebble in their shoe in the second half of the season is EDward Gaming, who bested them 2-0 in a tight-knit affair . And that's exactly who Bilibili are facing tomorrow in the upper semifinals . Historically, BLG have always been Robin to EDG's Batman. Only twice in seven encounters — three Bo5s — have the former managed to win a map against the latter, and never have they secured a full victory. But there's always been something on the line: elimination, Champions qualification, a VCT slot. Now that they're only fighting for regional gold, who knows what could happen."

    "cleaned_content": "The VCT China playoffs opened with a single-elimination game between Trace Esports and All Gamers . Trace looked comfortable across both maps and took away AG's chances at Champions in a 2-0 series. Aside from a slip-up against JDG Esports , Trace had an otherwise stellar Stage 2 with a 4-1 record, including a win over FunPlus Phoenix . In contrast, All Gamers struggled to maintain form throughout the stage. AG ended with three straight losses to JDG, Trace, and FPX and narrowly squeaked into the playoffs as the eighth seed with a 5-5 record. The map veto resulted in AG picking into Lotus, a map they had played just twice in 2024, despite it being Trace's second most played map with a 67% win rate, including an overtime victory over FPX. Trace picked into their comfort pick, Sunset, which they had played 12 times this year with a 58% win rate. Haven was left over as the decider. AG's comeback into the map wouldn't last for long. AG picking into one of Trace's comforts proved a fatal mistake early on in the series as Trace looked dominant in the early stages of Lotus. A 9-3 first half on the attack was spearheaded by impactful lurks from Kai and heybay . Information from these lurks was capitalized upon by a slow control of the map that adapted well to AG's Deadlock and Cypher composition. Oversteps in the anti-eco from Trace after winning the second pistol allowed AG to close the gap to just three rounds before Trace shut them down thanks to a high impact 3K from Biank to take the first map 13-7. Kai displayed why he had been a top performer for his side in 2024 with the Sentinel dropping 23 kills and 175 ADR across the 20 rounds played. A +13 K/D combined with an 80% opening duel win rate was too much for AG as they struggled to compete with Trace's individuals in multiple pivotal moments. Biank paved the way for his team to close out the first map. Trace once again took the pistol to kick off Sunset but this time around AG looked much more composed. Trace operated on a game plan of taking aggressive map control throughout their defense with multiple set plays but strong performances from Spitfires and deLb allowed AG to take a slight lead at 7-5 before moving to the defense. Trace took their fourth pistol in a row to start the second half and carried this momentum to an early close. Trace managed to take five straight to start the second half thanks to their fourth pistol in a row and back-to-back 2v4s that propelled their momentum. AG managed to take just three rounds before Trace took Sunset 13-10 and the series 2-0. Another strong performance from former BLG player Biank with 18 kills and 149 ADR on Sova aided in his team's strong showing across the series. After relinquishing his role as an IGL and under the leadership of heybay, Biank has blossomed into a strong supportive element to complement the existing firepower of Kai and FengF. heybay's 1v2 secured the anti-eco. Trace have guaranteed qualification for Champions 2024 with their win over All Gamers and will face off against FPX in the double-elimination bracket. AG have been eliminated from Champions qualification contention."

A veteran in the competitive scene with a notable track record, Victor was a part of the original ENVY core that attended eight majors over the course of three years. Their most successful year, 2022, net them a first, second, and third place finish at all three international events. Chet, having joined later in the 2021 season, assisted the team throughout their journey, providing additional structure and discipline to take the squad to new heights. Demon1, on the other hand, was a breakout rookie who took the scene by storm in 2023 after hoisting North America's first-ever Champions trophy in front of a home crowd. He spent time in Tier 3 prior to being picked up by Evil Geniuses and made two grand final appearances at both of the majors he attended. Following 2023's Champions, he would go on to sign with NRG ahead of the 2024 season. NRG hit a roadblock after their 2023 Champions run was cut short by two convincing losses to Chinese underdogs Bilibili Gaming , prompting Pujan \" FiNESSE \" Mehta and Sam \" s0m \" Oh to step down from the roster to pursue streaming while Ardis \" ardiis \" Svarenieks returned to EMEA to rejoin his teammates on Natus Vincere . Through thick and thin, the duo of Austin \" crashies \" Roberts and Victor was ever-reliant, allowing for a rebuild around the pair for the 2024 season. After onboarding world champions Ethan \" Ethan \" Arnold and Demon1, NRG brought back another familiar face – Jimmy \" Marved \" Nguyen – to reunite with crashies and Victor. With a roster of five ready for the Americas Kickoff , the team looked to qualify for Masters Madrid early on, but were denied a spot after falling to Sentinels – the eventual international winners – in the qualifying match of playoffs. Hoping to shake off their loss as a fluke and nothing more, NRG entered Stage 1 with Masters Shanghai in their sights. However, their results were far worse than at Kickoff, as the team failed to even qualify for playoffs, leading to more roster changes that saw the return of FNS and s0m while Demon1 was benched and Marved released. Despite these changes, Split 2 once again yielded similar results; NRG barely missed out on playoffs, this time being denied an appearance at Champions . In preparation for next season, the organization opted to not renew Victor's contract, while releasing Chet and their analyst duo of Vladimir \" vladk0r \" Kornev and yeboislays , the former potentially eyeing a return to the Counter Strike scene. Victor has stated that he is now a free agent for the upcoming season, while Chet announced that he is open to offers in franchising and challengers, as well as CS2.

    "cleaned_content": "FNATIC kickstarted their VCT EMEA Stage 2 playoffs run with a 2-1 victory over Karmine Corp , the third in a row against the Blue Wall. Tonight's win is a point of consistency for FNATIC, who are on a flawless run since returning from China, and inches them closer to another EMEA title. It's also their third consecutive win against Karmine Corp. FNATIC have traditionally made short work of KCorp in their bouts since the latter's inception into the VCT. KCorp's only win in that time was in this year's Kickoff semifinals , where they took a 2-0 shortly before lifting the trophy altogether. Today, however, was an exception, as the two teams endured a grueling series that only ended with FNATIC's 13-6 victory on Lotus. Prior to that, though, the momentum seemed to be all for the Blue Wall. Despite a hot start from Alfajer , when he dropped four in the second round, his team quickly cooled off. KCorp pressed on to a 13-7 win, and nearly made the same happen on Sunset, where FNATIC needed an overtime in map two to eventually clinch a match win. A heroic performance from hiro was the deciding factor, as it was his 30-bomb and 1.29 rating that let FNATIC bounce back from a sure loss to a 15-13 win on Sunset. He also kicked Lotus off the right way with the game's only ace. Never forget that wall is paper-thin. FNATIC's early control on Icebox and Sunset seemed to slip from them in later rounds, but they remained headstrong on Lotus and never gave KCorp room to breathe. This was due, in part, to several key rounds from the likes of Chronicle . Despite being the fourth-best player in the server by rating, his six multikills kept KCorp at bay throughout the decider. At the end of it all though, Alfajer and hiro were the ones to stand out from the crowd, totalling 105 kills between them and holding up a 1.09 and 1.03 rating, respectively. Even still, those numbers pale in comparison to the heroics of N4RRATE and sh1n , as they averaged a 1.30 and 1.11 match rating. The KCorp pair's stats were better in most fields compared to the FNATIC duo, but were not enough to carry their team over the line. As FNATIC's lead grew, so did Alfajer's hype. (Photo by Michal Konkol/Riot Games) Karmine Corp's elimination does not spell the end for them, though. EMEA will take four teams to Champions via points — five if FNATIC win the Stage 2 playoffs — and the Blue Wall currently sit in fourth. Should Vitality slide and crash out of the playoffs — which would require consecutive losses to Team Heretics and FUT Esports /FNATIC — KCorp will edge them out in points and qualify for Seoul. FNATIC, on the other hand, are cruising easy. The team have already claimed their spot at Champions via circuit points, and are now merely fighting for regional glory. Tonight's win is the start of a run towards an unprecedented third regional title in EMEA, back-to-back EMEA trophies, and a way for FNATIC to remind themselves they can still be the international powerhouse that dominated 2023. They just have to take it one step at a time. The next step is tomorrow, when they take on FUT Esports in the second semifinal of the upper bracket."

    "cleaned_content": "The VCT EMEA league playoffs opened with an elimination match between Natus Vincere and Team Vitality , with Vitality winning 2-1. The winner would make it into the double-elimination bracket. Throughout their regular season, Vitality had improved upon their Stage One performance, winning three of their four games this split. On the other hand, NAVI had only found a singular win this split but made it to playoffs thanks to their Stage 1 record. The map veto saw NAVI choose the opener to be Haven. FNATIC had demolished Vitality on that map the last time they played it, so NAVI leaned into that possible advantage. Vitality countered with one of their comfort picks, Sunset, and the decider came down to Ascent. Vitality got off to a blistering start on Haven on attack with six round wins in a row convincingly. It came down to ardiis to win out a couple one versus one clutches to get NAVI on the board. From there, however, he invested in an operator and used it to great effect through the map. NAVI were able to stabilize and get themselves to a 6-6 half despite the rough beginning. NAVI were hitting some crispy shots on Haven. Vitality won the pistol after they swapped to defense, with Sayf finding a 3K. However, NAVI won the anti-eco and brought the score to 9-7. The momentum was in their favor, and Vitality's eco was broken. In the next round, Sayf found a 4K with the help of his Jett knives, but that was Vitality's last push. NAVI won the next four rounds consecutively to take the map 13-8. Ardiis had insane impact on the map, winning multiple clutches and finding 13 kills with just the operator. In comparison, he found 12 in total during all of Split 2. Despite their loss on map 1, Vitality looked extremely comfortable on map two, Sunset. Both teams rocked a mirror comp, but Sayf on Neon dominated 31-15 the last time he played the agent. Starting on attack again, they once more found themselves up 6-0 before NAVI won a round. NAVI brought the score up to 6-2 but Vitality recovered their footing, continuing their quick-paced entries off the back of Neon and Kayo. Sayf found three 3Ks in the first half, and Vitality found themselves with a 10-2 lead. NAVI seemed to recover a bit on attack after a pistol win and anti-eco conversion but the damage had been done. Vitality closed out the map, losing only one more round, 13-5. The momentum had shifted. Vitality dominated on Sunset. On Ascent, NAVI started on defense and for the first time today, found success right off the bat with a 4-1 lead and in round five, were five against one. trexx however, with some clean headshots and positioning won out the 1v5 to get Vitality on the board. The round that shifted the tides in favor of Vitality. The rest of the squad seemed to wake up after, with NAVI and Vitality trading rounds back and forth until the half ended 7-5 in NAVI's favor. On defense, Vitality looked like a whole other team. They won the pistol, anti-eco, and bonus convincingly, setting up the team's economy for an early operator buy on Sayf. They would not lose a single round on defense, with Trexx and Kicks both dropping 20-bombs. Vitality took Ascent 13-7 and the series 2-1, propelling them forward in the bracket. Unfortunately for NAVI, their competitive season for 2024 concludes with this loss. Both Sayf and trexx, the former on the duelist and the latter on Sova, ended the series with 53 kills and over 250 ACS apiece. While NAVI looked better in terms of first kills, especially on the first map, Vitality looked much more cohesive as a team. Vitality will face Team Heretics tomorrow in the upper semifinals."

    "cleaned_content": "The second season of VCT EMEA has concluded, setting the stage for Champions Seoul qualification. Due to the inclusion of Kickoff at the beginning of the year, teams played one round-robin throughout the year, split into two stages. This allowed Stage 2 to integrate both groups into one league table, of which the top-six overall would advance to playoffs. FUT Esports and Team Heretics both earned top seeds, avoiding the single elimination portion of the bracket. Alongside Heretics, three teams return to playoffs for the third time this year: FNATIC , Karmine Corp , and Natus Vincere . Team Vitality round out the top-six, after only losing once to group leaders FNATIC in the second half of the year. Three teams maintained hopes until the end Playoffs entry came down to the final day of the season, with three different teams relying on the results of the last two matches, NAVI vs. Gentle Mates and Vitality vs. Karmine Corp , to punch their tickets to the knockout stage. Gentle Mates needed a victory against NAVI to stay in contention, while Team Liquid were hoping for the same result for an opportunity at playoffs. A Gentle Mates victory could potentially end in a five-way tie between teams with a 4-6 record, which meant the final game of the season would confirm the final two playoff teams. NAVI needed to win the series, but were coming into the match with a five-game losing streak. The team had failed to win a single map since their Stage 1 playoffs match against Team Heretics, and their year was on the line. The team opted for a return to their signature roles, with Shao on initiator and ANGE1 on controller. This decision helped them take their opponent's map pick, Sunset, but they lost Ascent 13-8. In the end, a close win on the decider map secured NAVI a spot in playoffs and eliminated both Gentle Mates and Liquid from Champions contention. Rookies surprise, Derke dominates In terms of rating, a handful of newcomers and returning players joined the usual suspects towards the top of the table. Last-minute FNATIC pickup hiro appeared among the top ten, while KOI 's rookie controller grubinho showed up fifth overall. Despite a negative record in the stage, a second KOI player, sheydos , entered the ten highest-rated players, with a 1.17 rating. This marks his first top-ten placement in an EMEA regular season since 2022. By far the standout player was Derke , who topped the region in terms of rating, ACS, KD ratio, ADR, and KPR. In fact, he was the only primary duelist player to feature in the top ten players in terms of rating, with Sayf and cNed barely missing out at 11th and 12th, respectively. VCT EMEA 2024 Stage 2 Regular Season results Due to the circuit point system for Champions qualification, the cutoff for which teams made it to the Stage 2 playoffs was determined by their overall regular season results, not just their Stage 2 performance. The top-six teams from the regular season have a chance to qualify directly to Champions 2024 via the EMEA playoffs, as well as a last opportunity to earn points and qualify as the region's fourth seed. Here is how each team performed in Stage 2: Group Alpha: FNATIC (4-0, +40) Team Vitality (3-1, +7) BBL Esports (1-3, -5) Karmine Corp (1-3, -20) Team Liquid (1-3, -22) Group Omega: Team Heretics (5-0, +50) FUT Esports (4-1, +37) KOI (2-3, +4) GIANTX (2-3, -31) Natus Vincere (1-4, -44) Gentle Mates (1-4, -16) Here are the overall regular season results for VCT EMEA 2024: Team Heretics (8-2, +61, 12 pts.) FUT Esports (8-2, +76, 11 pts.) FNATIC (7-3, +46, 13 pts.) Team Vitality (6-4, -14, 6 pts.) Natus Vincere (5-5, -13, 5 pts.) Karmine Corp (4-6, -5, 8 pts.) BBL Esports (4-6, -1, eliminated from Champions contention) Team Liquid (4-6, -23, elim.) Gentle Mates (3-7, -42, elim.) GIANTX (3-7, -58, elim.) KOI (3-7, -27, elim.) Due to the circuit point system, FNATIC have already qualified to Champions. They can still qualify through the knockout stage and earn a higher seed, but, should they not win any games in playoffs, no team can place outside the top three while earning more points than them. Playoff preview The VCT EMEA 2024 Stage 2 playoffs begin on July 15, with the first matches being single elimination games. Those two matches are between the third to sixth seeds from the regular season, starting with: Team Vitality vs. Natus Vincere - 12:00 EDT / 18:00 CEST FNATIC vs. Karmine Corp - 15:00 EDT / 21:00 CEST The two winners in the knockout round will then face off against Heretics and FUT in a four-team double-elimination format. (Winner of Game 1) vs. Team Heretics - 12:00 EDT / 18:00 CEST (Winner of Game 2) vs. FUT Esports - 15:00 EDT / 21:00 CEST Team Heretics and FUT Esports received a bye due to their performance. As the top two teams in the tournament, they will need to win a single match to qualify to Champions. Should either of them fail to win a match, they will need FNATIC to place in the top three to qualify via circuit points. With eight championship points, Karmine Corp need to either reach the top three or for the three teams above them to qualify via playoffs. Lastly, Team Vitality and Natus Vincere need to win two matches in order to make Champions. They will face off against each other in the single elimination portion of the bracket, meaning the winner will need another victory to make Champions, while the loser would be directly eliminated. Coverage Coverage for the 2024 EMEA playoffs will continue on VLR.gg. Pick ‘ems are open until July 15, 17:59 CEST, while a live match ticker and statistics will be updated throughout the remainder of the event."

    "cleaned_content": "The VCT China 2024 regular season is over. The end of Stage 2 marks which teams can compete in the regional playoffs and fight for the three remaining China slots at Champions 2024. Six teams will start their playoff journey on July 16, including regional favorites EDward Gaming and FunPlus Phoenix alongside Bilibili Gaming , JDG Esports , Trace Esports , and All Gamers . Though they aren't in the playoffs, Dragon Ranger Gaming still have a chance to qualify via points if specific outcomes are met, mainly if Trace beats AG and if JDG ends in fourth place. In Stage 2, EDG and FPX underperformed while Bilibili Gaming and JDG Esports rose to the top. Both EDG and FPX still qualified for playoffs due to their regular season, but none of the Chinese teams that returned from Masters Shanghai did well in Stage 2. Bilibili Gaming finished at the top of Group Alpha over EDG, while JDG Esports and Trace Esports finished ahead of FPX in Group Omega. A Bilibili Gaming win over Nova Esports highlighted Stage 2 Across the games in Stage 2, the series between Nova Esports and Bilibili Gaming stood out as a close battle for two potential playoff teams. Nova made it to the knockouts of the Stage 1 playoffs but lost in the knockout round to Dragon Ranger Gaming , who eventually placed third and qualified for Masters Shanghai. Bilibili Gaming, despite their upset wins over NRG at Champions in 2023, started slowly in 2024 and missed out on both Masters Madrid and Shanghai. Bilibili came out the gates hot in Stage 2 by sweeping Wolves Esports but then had to face a tougher opponent in Nova to solidify their playoff chances. Bilibili were gaining new form thanks to some additions to the roster. Picking up both former BLEED player Marcus \" nephh \" Tan and former TYLOO player Lo \" Flex1n \" Rui (罗瑞) made Bilibili a more well-rounded squad. Nova were continuing to improve from Stage 1, with their players all stepping up statistically heading into this series. Map one was a wildly entertaining nailbiter that went in favor of Nova, while maps two and three showed great resilience from a Bilibili team looking to redeem their season. This win was crucial for Bilibili to qualify for the Stage 2 playoffs, while Nova lost and missed out. Outstanding players from VCT China 2024 Stage 2 Three players across Stage 2 had a significant impact on their team performance in the final stretch of the season. The first is one everyone is familiar with: Zheng \" ZmjjKK \" Yongkang (郑永康) . ZmjjKK posing after a victory in VCT China 2024 Stage 2. (Image via Riot Games) After returning from Masters Shanghai, EDG stumbled with a 2-2 record but ZmjjKK retained his status as the most talented player in China. He led the league in ACS with 275.1, kills per round with 0.96, and average damage per round with 171.6. ZmjjKK started to play Neon due to the meta shift, and his stats showed no drop-off. Another player who stood out was Park \" stew \" Young-chan (박영찬) from JDG Esports. Not only did his team go 4-1, but he ended Stage 2 with the highest K:D ratio at 1.48. He improved in every stat from Stage 1 to Stage 2 and proved himself as a duelist who could help his team beat many other squads eyeing their final chance at Champions. Wang \" whzy \" Haozhe (王昊哲) has always been, statistically, the star player from the Bilibili Gaming core. He ended Stage 2 tied second at first kills per round with 0.22 while sticking around the top seven across other key stats without playing Neon like the other two standout players above. His stats remained consistently high from Stage 1 to Stage 2 as he helped lead Bilibili to their first playoff game in 2024. VCT China 2024 Stage 2 and Regular Season results Due to the circuit point system for Champions qualification, the cutoff for which teams made it to the Stage 2 playoffs was determined by their overall regular season results and international tournament wins, not just their Stage 2 results. The top-six teams from the regular season have one more chance to earn points and qualify for Champions 2024 by performing well in the Stage 2 playoffs. Here is how each Chinese team performed in Stage 2: Group Alpha: Bilibili Gaming (3-1, +20) EDward Gaming (2-2, +6) Nova Esports (2-2, -12) Wolves Esports (2-2, -3) Dragon Ranger Gaming (1-3, -11) Group Omega: JDG Esports (4-1, +41) Trace Esports (4-1, +9) FunPlus Phoenix (2-3, -5) All Gamers (2-3, -12) TYLOO (2-3, -28) Titan Esports Club (1-4, -5) Here are the overall regular season results for VCT China 2024: EDward Gaming (7-3, +56) FunPlus Phoenix (7-3, +50) Trace Esports (7-3, +26) JDG Esports (5-5, +36) Bilibili Gaming (5-5, -8) All Gamers (5-5, -15) Nova Esports (4-6, -26) Dragon Ranger Gaming (4-6, -18) TYLOO (4-6, -31) Wolves Esports (4-6, -31) Titan Esports Club (3-7, -39) Due to the circuit point system, both how FunPlus Phoenix and how EDward Gaming perform in the Stage 2 playoffs will not matter for Champions qualification, but only for regional seeding. Teams across all regions will send the top three teams from the Stage 2 playoffs as well as the best remaining regional team via regional points. Playoff preview The VCT China 2024 Stage 2 playoffs begin on July 16, with the only single elimination games in the knockout round. Those two matches are between the third to sixth seeds from the regular season, starting with: Trace Esports vs. All Gamers JDG Esports vs. Bilibili Gaming The two winners in the knockout round will then face off against EDG and FPX in a four-team double-elimination format. (Winner of Game 1) vs. FunPlus Phoenix (Winner of Game 2) vs. EDward Gaming When the Stage 2 playoffs end, the top three teams will book their tickets to Champions 2024 alongside EDG. If EDG do well in the tournament and take one of those top three slots, the next-best regional team via circuit points will make it to Seoul."

Despite high expectations, GE bombed out of LOCK//IN against Team Vitality in the first round. The 2023 regular season would not play so kindly for Global Esports. A cacophony of problems plagued the team, including visa issues for Indian players Ganesh \" SkRossi \" Gangadhar and Abhirup \" Lightningfast \" Choudhury in the opening weeks alongside complications with GE's seven-player roster. The team ultimately ended the season in eighth place with a 3-6 record. GE capped off the year with another first-round knockout, this time to Rex Regum Qeon in the LCQ. Following the loss, Spin was promoted to head coach in place of Eraser, who parted with the team. Desiring greater results to make up for their lackluster debut season, Global Esports once more revamped their roster for 2024, splitting with five of their previous players while opting to keep only Lightningfast. Spin reunited with former TENSTAR members Russel \" Russ \" Mendes and Niko \" Polvi \" Polvinen , bringing alongside him tenured Pacific veterans Gary \" blaZek1ng \" Dastin and Benedict \" Benkai \" Tan . Global Esports entered Kickoff desperate to find success amidst mountains of criticism. Renewed hopes were not enough to find the results desired, as two quick sweeps in the opening and deciding match by ZETA DIVISION knocked GE out of contention for Madrid. Splits 1 and 2 yielded similar results, with GE finding only three wins combined to once again fall short of making an international event. Just days after their final match of the year against Gen.G , Spin announced that he had chosen to resign from Global Esports, with BigTime also leaving the team.

When the best players in the world competed in LA at Champions 2023, he had just finished a season for Diamant Esports in the Eastern European tier two Valorant scene. His goal was to get back to tier one, and his shot at reaching it was slipping away. After playing for Case Esports between seasons, the FPS veteran got his second opportunity in tier one thanks to Team Heretics needing a sixth man. It wasn't a permanent role, which was clear from the start. Team Heretics had a star initiator, Mert \" Wo0t \" Alkan , who could not play for the first couple months of the year due to his age. Until Wo0t turned 18, paTiTek had his opportunity in the limelight once again. Both Team Heretics and paTiTek entered the year with few expectations but immediately showed the world that they were not to be trifled with. Out of all regions, EMEA had two of the biggest surprises in their Kickoff tournament. Karmine Corp and Team Heretics rose to the top off the backs of great teamwork and fresh talent. Nobody could deny the radiance around the youth movement in EMEA, especially since Heretics were playing with one of their prodigies on the bench. According to paTiTek, it didn't take long for him to realize that the team's potential was much higher than others predicted. “Before Kickoff, I just wanted to show I could play at the highest level,” paTiTek said. “The expectations then arrived when we first played together and I got along with them. I realized that we had the potential to truly make something good. I was a little stressed and constantly overthinking, especially on stage. I think I wasn't performing to my standards, but the team was doing great.” paTiTek poses on stage at Masters Madrid. (Image via Riot Games) Team Heretics had plenty of stars even with Wo0t not available. Dominykas \" MiniBoo \" Lukaševičius fit in perfectly alongside his veteran older brother Ričardas \" Boo \" Lukaševičius , while Benjamin \" benjyfishy \" David Fish showed that the talent he hinted at toward the end of VCT 2023 was just a taste of what was to come. Heading from the stage in Berlin to playing in front of a big crowd in Madrid, paTiTek felt the pressure build for Heretics. He may have been one of the oldest players on the roster, but his only prior time playing against the best in Valorant was during the pandemic. Madrid was his first major LAN, and he felt like his performance there was unacceptable. “Everyone on the team had their inexperience playing on a big stage like that, including me,” paTiTek said. “ Paper Rex was one of my hardest games mentally because it was a knockout game and I performed super badly. For me it was a huge blow, being a sixth man and wanting just to do my best. I was on the verge of crying post-match. It was unacceptable for my standards and it just sucked to be in that moment. It was a huge learning moment for me though, because I knew what went wrong and what I could adjust after.” Team Heretics faced two of the best teams in the tournament, Sentinels and Paper Rex, and lost to both. The team was eliminated, and with Wo0t returning weeks into the Stage 1 regular season, paTiTek knew that his best chance to prove himself so far had been a failure. He vowed to himself that if he got that second chance at an international event, it would be different. Stage 1 kept the team's expectations high. Team Heretics remained a regional competitor coming back from Madrid, but paTiTek stepped away as Wo0t turned 18 and joined the roster. Now a free agent, paTiTek still couldn't get his mind off his performance at Madrid and even considered retiring from competitive Valorant. “Going back to Berlin, my mindset was just to move on and perform, but that loss still lingered and made me think about my place in tier one,” paTiTek said. “After Wo0t rejoined the roster, I went home and focused on relaxing and improving my mental health. I thought if I got another opportunity in tier one it would be very different. If I didn't, I thought it just wasn't meant to be. I just played ranked, met with friends, and just waited to see what my future was.” paTiTek huddles alongside Team Heretics. (Image via Riot Games) In that short downtime, Team Heretics fought back to their regional finals and finished in second place. This meant that the team was headed to back-to-back international events, now traveling to Shanghai. Yet, a roster problem struck Team Heretics once again when MiniBoo decided to take a break for his studies. Heretics needed a substitute to fill in for the international event. As it turned out, they had the perfect player in mind: a flex who was familiar with their team from just weeks prior. “I accepted, of course, who wouldn't?” paTiTek said. “We went with basically zero practice with this adjusted team. We took it as another learning curve for us, taking the challenge in a more fun way, so the mood was completely different than in Madrid. I realized this was my second chance, and my improved confidence showed.” Team Heretics were heading into Shanghai just as they had when VCT 2024 began: with no expectations. They moved Wo0t from his traditional initiator role to duelist so paTiTek could fit into the roster. It looked like a desperate change until Wo0t started to get comfortable on Jett and sniped through top duelists along the team's path to the finals. Despite eliminating the Chinese home teams, a feat that could've made them the villains of the event, the crowd picked them as their favorites and cheered for them the loudest as Shanghai entered the playoff stage. paTiTek looks as Gen.G win the Masters Shanghai finals. (Image via Riot Games) Everyone on the team looked reinvigorated, but paTiTek specifically stepped up in comparison to his performance at Madrid, finishing fourth in assists per round across the entire tournament . It all clicked at Shanghai thanks to one active change he focused on. “Originally, I think I was too hectic of a player both in gameplay and comms,” paTiTek said, “so I actively tried to be more chill and see the game from a bird's eye view. I wasn't thinking my decisions through, and my focus for Shanghai was going back to the fundamentals.” One of his best moments was in the lower finals, as he clutched on one health against G2 Esports . Despite losing in the finals to Gen.G 3-2 , paTiTek's performance has demonstrated his skills as a tier-one player. He showed his ability to adapt quickly to new circumstances and opponents, while still improving as a player. Now, paTiTek is physically back in the same position he was after Wo0t joined Heretics, but not mentally, having broken through one of the toughest moments of his competitive career and completed his redemption arc. “In Shanghai, I managed to uphold my standards,” paTiTek said. “I showed my talent but also kept that level head and I knew I could be a hero if my team needed me to be. For me, it was redemption for Madrid, and I succeeded.”"

This announcement comes alongside new information for the 2025 Challengers and Ascension formats. In order to fill out the remainder of the 2024 calendar, Riot will add a third Challengers stage to the end of the year. Additionally, Challengers APAC will be reduced from nine to five total regions, as the six Southeast Asian leagues will be condensed down to a single Challengers SEA region. The third Challengers stage of the year will integrate Premier teams into the competition, featuring Challengers Split 2 teams as well as 2-12 teams from their respective Premier region. More details on each tournament will be confirmed at a later date by local organizers. The updated calendar for Challengers Pacific The Challengers SEA consolidation is a part of Riot's plans for Premier and Challengers to have a direct connection, meaning only the top Premier Asia teams will qualify to Challengers SEA. Outside of the streamlined path to pro, Riot mentions the change being beneficial for its partners and the level of play in the long-term, and the new Challengers league will better reflect the broader Pacific ecosystem in terms of regional integration and competition. The current regions that will be combined into Challengers SEA are Indonesia, Malaysia/Singapore, Philippines, Taiwan/Hong Kong, Thailand, and Vietnam. The new Challengers SEA region will begin competition in Stage 3. The top two active teams from the previous regions will be invited directly, while remaining teams will participate in the Premier Invite division of Premier Asia. The top four teams from Premier will join Challengers SEA, rounding out the participants at sixteen teams."

    "cleaned_content": "Last week, Riot revealed their plans for the 2025 Challengers circuit, including a calendar update and complete overhaul of the Ascension system. Following the announcement, Riot has further expanded on details for the overall EMEA T2 format. Format Updates The 2025 season will keep the three stage calendar first introduced in 2024. Next year, however, will bring increased opportunities for cross-regional play in order to increase competition throughout the year. Every stage, the top two teams from each Challengers League (excluding MENA) will qualify to a Challengers EMEA tournament. The intention is to allow the best teams in EMEA to play more frequently against each other, benefitting both the teams and viewers. Due to ping differences, MENA teams will only participate in the Stage 3 EMEA tournament. Stage 1 and Stage 2 will simply conclude with a regional playoff, similar to the format currently in place. In terms of Ascension qualification, teams will now earn \"Championship Points\" through the EMEA tournaments. Further details on region-specific formats and the new points system will be unveiled at a later date. Italy, Portugal reunite with Challengers Spain With the intention of further streamlining Premier qualification into Challengers, Challengers Italy and Portugal have returned to compete under the Challengers Spain banner. This will allow teams from the three regions, currently playing under the Premier IBIT (Iberia and Italy) region to qualify directly into a Challengers League comprising the same regions. The new Challengers League will be made up of four Spanish teams, the top team from Portugal, the top team from Italy, a “Wildcard” team, and an open qualifier team. The three regions last played under the same banner in the 2022 VRLs, but were separated the next year due to a lack of representation for Portuguese and Italian players. In 2022, nine Spanish teams were invited to the main event, while only one team from Portugal and one from Italy were invited to the initial Closed Qualifier of the year. The Game Changers Express Lane Due to the improving performance of Game Changers teams and players in the mixed circuit, as well as the tightly packed schedule between Challengers and Game Changers events, Riot is adding a new “Express Lane Mechanic” for eligible Game Changers participants. This new mechanic will allow certain Game Changers teams to advance directly to Challengers open qualifiers, in order to avoid conflicts in their schedule between the two competitions. The Express Lane will also help encourage teams to participate in mixed events, as well as give the players opportunity to keep improving by playing against different teams."

The coach is supposedly in discussions with numerous American and European organizations. Before Valorant's release, Chet spent his time as a coach in Counter Strike. His greatest achievements were under NRG and Evil Geniuses , winning four international titles and even earning EG a brief title as the best team in the world in 2019. Among the initial batch of talent that migrated to Valorant back in 2020, Chet began his stay in North America with NRG Esports before rotating to TSM and then ENVY , where his rise to fame amongst coaches kicked off. His time spent with the Envy core of Pujan \" FiNESSE \" Mehta , Austin \" crashies \" Roberts , and Victor \" Victor \" Wong netted him a first, second, and third-place finish at all three majors of 2022. In terms of international results, his performances would set the bar for coaches and teams alike heading into 2023. Unfortunately, last year's VCT season did not end as successfully as the previous one for Chet. After exiting LOCK//IN early at the hands of LOUD , the adjusted NRG roster was only able to secure a fourth-place finish at Masters Tokyo as their best placement of the year. Despite being favored to exit the group stage at Champions 2023 , the squad fell 0-2 to Bilibili Gaming twice to cut their stay in L.A. short. This year's results have plummeted yet again, with NRG failing to make both Masters events so far while only securing three victories throughout Stage 1. Numerous roster changes have affected the team, the most recent being swapping in FNS and Sam \" s0m \" Oh in place of Jimmy \" Marved \" Nguyen and Max \" Demon1 \" Mazanov . NRG have one more chance to qualify for Champions , the most realistic being a direct qualification through a run at playoffs."

    "cleaned_content": "Riot has revealed updates to the Challengers format for the upcoming 2025 season, including changes to the Ascension system and further tuning of the Premier pathway to Challengers. The 2025 season will introduce performance-based extension for Ascension teams and the removal of auto-relegation. The new Premier Invite Division will directly provide an opportunity to compete for a spot in Challengers. In addition, Challenger Leagues will span the entire year, with new Challenger tournaments to take place in Fall 2024. Ascension Changes Currently, Ascension teams are guaranteed a two-year stay in their respective International Leagues (IL), after which they face automatic relegation back to Challengers. Starting in 2025, Ascension slots will be determined by the teams' performance throughout the season instead, shortening the default term length to one year but providing the opportunity to extend it indefinitely. International leagues will be capped at 12 teams. Auto-relegation is no more. At the end of the season, Ascension teams are presented with two potential pathways to retain their slot in the International League. Teams can extend their stay in by qualifying for Champions. Should both Ascension teams make it to Champions, the higher-placed team at the end of the event will retain their slot while the other can compete at Ascension for their spot. Teams can also defend their slot if they finish in the top eight, giving them a chance to play in Ascension against the winners of each respective regional Challengers. If a team misses the playoffs entirely, they will be automatically relegated to Challengers. Premier Promotion and Calendar Updates Challengers will run for the full length of the year. In December last year , Riot introduced Premier as the primary system for teams to qualify for the Challengers series. In April, Riot also introduced the addition of Invite Division, the highest tier of play within Premier that teams must qualify for, replacing the current Contender Division. Teams that place in the top 32 of the Contender Division will gain an automatic invite to the Invite Division. The Invite Division will start in Episode 9 Act 1, roughly in early July, with teams from the division gaining a chance to compete for Promotion/Relegation every two Acts of Premier. Starting in Fall 2024, the winners of Invite Division and eligible teams from E9A1 and E9A2 will be eligible for Promotion/Relegation tournaments as part of a series of new Challengers tournaments. Further details will be revealed by Riot and regional tournament organizers in the upcoming weeks."

However, the team failed to qualify for Masters Madrid after falling to Karmine Corp , marking the first time FNATIC missed out on an international event since 2021. Despite ending Split 1 atop of EMEA and securing a first seed to China's biggest VCT event, FNATIC looked shaky throughout the regular season and playoffs, where Leo visibly showed signs of illness in the grand final against Team Heretics . Even in Shanghai, Leo was afflicted by food poisoning and returned home earlier than expected after suffering losses to FUT Esports and eventual-champions Gen.G .

This was the first time these two organizations had faced each other in franchising, and the first time a Pacific team has won an international VCT trophy. Gen.G returned to the Masters final again after their previous showing, redeeming themselves with a map-five win instead of their map-five loss at Madrid . Team Heretics finished both second in EMEA and at Masters Shanghai, despite playing with both Wo0t on duelist and a substitute in paTiTek . Gen.G and Team Heretics bump fists before the VCT 2024 Masters Shanghai grand finals. (Image via Riot Games) The map veto went as follows: Gen.G banned Bind and Sunset to pick Breeze first, and then Team Heretics picked Icebox. Gen.G picked Ascent next and Team Heretics picked Lotus, leaving Split as the potential final map. Gen.G started confidently on Breeze Team Heretics brought back Skye to start Breeze. Gen.G ran their default Ascent comp, with the Yoru, Jett, and Astra. Thanks to Lakia , the first pistol round only took seconds for Gen.G to win. To try and convert their bonus, Gen.G bought t3xture an Operator which paid off as they won round three flawlessly. It took Team Heretics seven rounds to win their first. Their attack had two problems, and the first was t3xture posting up A site with his Operator. The second was that when Heretics wanted to end B, Meteor tricked opponents with his Yoru utility to slow them down. It was a stomp for Gen.G on their defense side. The Madrid finalists headed into the half up 10-2. Gen.G then pulled off a fake through mid to B to surprise Team Heretics. Munchkin got four kills, three of which happened as he sold the fake nearly single-handedly. The second pistol round went in favor of Gen.G as they reached 11-2. Team Heretics started their hope of a comeback by forcing what would be their eco round and converting it. Gen.G quickly dashed those hopes by securing two round wins to finish Breeze 13-6. Team Heretics ran away with Icebox to tie the series For Icebox, Team Heretics opted for a double initiator comp with Sova while Gen.G chose to run the same with Gekko. The first pistol for Icebox was close but Gen.G secured their third in the series. Despite losing many weapons on their antieco round, Gen.G converted their bonus with some clean Sherriff shots, revitalizing their economy. Team Heretics won their first round on their fifth attempt attacking on Icebox. Gen.G were succeeding in shutting down Wo0t, but Team Heretics instead relied on shots from RieNs and benjyfishy to fight back. A 4-0 lead for Gen.G disappeared into a 4-4 tie, but a perfect ultimate from t3xture to regain the lead seemingly flipped a switch for the star duelist. He remained valuable whether Gen.G played aggressively or passively on defense. Team Heretics entered the half down 7-5, managing to counter the tempo changes from Gen.G as their attack ended.

Both teams then proceeded to win three thrifty rounds in a row as the momentum shifted frequently. Team Heretics was the team that gained more out of the chaotic start to their defense and tied the map 9-9. Gen.G were able to secure plants thanks to Gekko, though the chip damage from RieNs made the Heretics retakes much easier. A defuse with 0.06 seconds on the clock put Heretics safely on top. Icebox ended 13-9, and the series was tied. Ascent was another great closeout from Heretics Both teams ran the standard Ascent composition, keeping the focus on the Jett duel between t3xture and Wo0t for the third map in a row. Meteor led Gen.G onto A site to keep their pistol win streak alive, then got three kills to convert their bonus round. A perfect flash swing out of A main allowed paTiTek to mow down Gen.G and once again stop the Gen.G run dead in its tracks. For the first time in the series, Wo0t started to show exactly why he was such an important part of Heretics' playoff run. Wo0t began to pick Gen.G apart with the Operator and made A site near impossible to execute onto. Team Heretics looked to get their first halftime lead of the series until Lakia made a high-risk flank to keep the teams tied at 6-6. Team Heretics won their first pistol win of the series on Ascent attack. After the eco and bonus went as expected, Gen.G fumbled a 2v1 against Boo to reinforce a 10-7 lead for Team Heretics. It looked dire for Gen.G as they fumbled advantages and left site defenses weak, allowing Team Heretics to win Icebox 13-9 to take the series lead. After only dropping 18 kills total across the first two maps, Wo0t shot his way to 23 kills on Ascent to lead the lobby. Gen.G stomped on Lotus to bring the series to the brink Just as on Ascent, both teams ran the same composition for Lotus. RieNs led Team Heretics to win the first pistol on Lotus and got a critical 2K to convert their bonus round. Heretics had a 3-0 lead, but Meteor denied them from pulling away with multiple hero plays. Gen.G turned the map back in their favor off of aggressive defenses. Moving from Jett to Raze, t3xture coordinated a perfect combo with Lakia to seize and nade at B main, resulting in a quadra kill from the nade alone. Team Heretics lost every round after converting their bonus to end the half down 9-3. Lakia celebrates a round win at the VCT 2024 Masters Shanghai grand finals. (Image via Riot Games) Gen.G won the second pistol in near-flawless fashion to put the map out of reach for Team Heretics. Munchkin converted the bonus to confirm a 12-round win streak, which dashed any hope of a Heretics comeback. Gen.G won Lotus 13-4 and took the series to map five. Split was a Gen.G masterclass The series ended on Split with the third straight mirror matchup. Meteor secured a 4K to win Gen.G their attack pistol round. They were confident to start Split, yet both teams showed resilience after going down early in maps earlier in the series. Split had to be the same for Heretics, but the map started to look as one-sided as Breeze and Lotus had for Gen.G. The change of pace was what truly made defense impossible for Team Heretics. t3xture was the spearhead for Gen.G, hitting his shots and taking plenty of space. Gen.G entered the half up 9-3, then won the second pistol round and secured the bonus. Split ended 13-3, and Gen.G clinched the Pacific region their first international win in VCT history. Across the series, t3xture posted an unbelievable 24 first-kills. Nobody else in the lobby had more than 15. Gen.G vindicated themselves after their Masters Madrid grand final loss, with the duo of t3xture and Meteor rising to the challenge when the team went down 2-1 in the series."

    "cleaned_content": "Team Heretics have put an end to G2 Esports ' Cinderella run at Masters Shanghai after defeating them 3-0 in their third matchup of the tournament. Today's results now see paTiTek surpass cgrs as the most-successful stand-in following a guaranteed top two placement at an international event. Tomorrow, Heretics will face Gen.G in Shanghai's final match to determine if either APAC or EMEA will lift their first trophy of the year. After two disappointing losses at the hands of North America's second seed, Heretics entered the lower final of Shanghai with a vengeance. G2's map pick of Bind could not have gone worse for North America's last hope as they were forced to submit in one of the quickest matches of the event. Turkish flex Wo0t led his team with inhuman stats: the youngster died a total of six times on Map 1 while ending with 20 kills. A monstrous ACS of 360 accompanied by a 58% headshot percentage told the story as G2 were simply unable to find a solution for the substitute duelist. After just 15 rounds of play, Heretics closed out Bind 13-2. Turkish aim. Looking to reset their mental, G2 entered Heretics' pick of Icebox strong by taking the pistol and a close second round. However, the same overwhelming layers of play from Heretics dictated the match early on, allowing for EMEA's pride to secure eight whole rounds to end the first half 8-4. RieNs stepped up to ensure that Wo0t was not the only Turkish player to draw roars from the crowd as he ended Icebox with 21 kills and an ACS of 279. Despite his continuous fragging and support, Wo0t still managed to hit the clip of the map and assist in bringing Heretics to a final scoreline of 13-6 on the box. Someone check on the NA fans, please. The last time Heretics took G2 to series point, they choked a huge lead on Ascent and were reverse-swept by the North Americans. Today, they made sure fans knew it was a fluke. A fast start on G2's pick of Lotus saw TH take an early 4-0 lead off the back of many mistakes on their opponents' side. G2 often gave openers or could not capitalize off of team fights over all three maps, and Heretics were all for it. Stand-in paTiTek was a menace on Viper, swapping off the Initiator role and playing for a more passive lurk style that allowed him to strike his prey when they least expected it. Rookie icy attempted to salvage his team with a notable performance on Raze, but the game was already over by the time G2 could gather their bearings. Whenever G2 seemed to have an advantage, round after round would fall apart before their very eyes. After a much-needed timeout on Round 7 from JoshRT following a Boo 3K, it took Heretics only one round and a paTiTek 1HP ace to prompt another from G2. Just a sub, btw. North America's last hope tried to muster the means of performing another nearly-impossible comeback, but the magic dust had already been exhausted enough, and the attack half of Lotus quickly came to a close as Heretics dragged a kicking and screaming G2 to the airport courtesy of a 13-8 scoreline. G2 only managed to grab 16 of 39 rounds over three maps. Heretics are now on the verge of securing EMEA yet another trophy. Only one team remains in their way: Gen.G. The Korean lineup have once again cruised their way to another international grand final in 2024. Last time, they were unable to claim APAC's first international trophy after falling to Sentinels 3-2 at Masters Madrid . Now, a very confident Team Heretics slowly approach the throne to challenge the kings. Gen.G will face their adversaries tomorrow for the crown."

Including Pacific tournaments, Gen.G have participated in four out of four possible grand finals during the 2024 season. The second match of the day went Team Heretics ' way, as they defeated 100 Thieves in a resounding 2-0. Gen.G will next play on Sunday with hopes of earning Pacific's first-ever international title. G2 will go down to the lower bracket, where they will play a best-of-five against Team Heretics to define the second finalist of Masters Shanghai. The day's results mean there will be no repeat international event winners this tournament, as Boostio and coach Zikz were the last remaining team members to win a title . Gen.G advance to Shanghai grand final with 2-0 win Gen.G opened the series with a pistol round win, and continued on to comfortably win the next few rounds. Meteor was a standout player in the beginning of their defense half, securing a series of multikills and first eliminations to help his team win seven rounds in a row. In round five, he found a 4K, which he capped off with a clutch to turn around what appeared to be a G2 stronghold on B. A tactical timeout after that round didn't immediately show results for G2, but they were able to win their first attack on round eight. G2 maintained the momentum for another seven rounds, but Gen.G made sure to keep their lead for the remainder of the map. A nice thrifty round gave G2 their eighth point, but they were unable to win any rounds afterwards. With four round wins in a row, Gen.G closed off their opponent's map pick 13-8. Meteor prevents G2 from appearing on the scoreboard. The Gen.G dominance carried over to Ascent, as they gained an early lead on their offense. Statistically both teams' best map throughout 2024, Ascent slightly favored Gen.G on the attack side compared to G2. Gen.G were unrelenting, as four of their eight round wins in the first half came off the back of quadruple kills. Their round wins were not simply due to mechanical superiority, however. Munchkin and Karon had 11 and 12 assists in the half, respectively, which helped set up the team's entries for success. As on Lotus, G2 began their recovery towards the end of the first half and the beginning of the second. They were slightly more successful this time around, but it was not enough. An ace against Gen.G's half buy earned icy the tenth round for his team, but Gen.G won the next two rounds to win the map 13-10. “We're the favorites,” Meteor said after the win. “We'll make sure we prove ourselves [in the grand final].” Team Heretics stay alive with 2-0 against 100 Thieves The day continued with the lower bracket match between Team Heretics and 100 Thieves. The North American team earned the first map pick, taking the match to Bind. They won the pistol round to kick off the series, but paTiTek answered back with a 1v2 clutch on the eco. Heretics took the lead the following round, and kept the advantage throughout the half. On their attack side, Wo0t and benjyfishy won eight of the ten opening duels they fought, giving their team multiple advantages to start the map. After halftime, 100 Thieves were back in the game. They complemented a pistol win with two four-round winstreaks, eventually reaching match point with a 12-9 score. The next three rounds involved three separate triple kills from the Heretics squad, stopping 100T's ideas in their tracks and sending the match to overtime. The teams continued trading attack rounds, but another defensive 3K from Wo0t left their opponents weak enough for Boo to clean up, ending the map 15-13. “I'm definitely very confident going into [Sunset],” 100 Thieves coach Zikz said after Bind. “We've seen a lot of film, so it should be easy for us to read them out.” Team Heretics were eager to prove him wrong. Their mastery of the map gained them the lead to start the map. For a brief moment, eeiu was the sole player fighting back, winning a 1v1 to give his team a round and coming close to winning the next round. By the end of the fifth round, 100 Thieves had called a timeout. They could not stop the bleeding, as any slight advantage they gained was quickly countered by Heretics' individual skill and teamplay. A second timeout after round eight proved just as futile. To summarize the first half with a statistic, Wo0t ended the first half with more eliminations than the bottom four 100 Thieves players combined. Even while surrounded, Boo and Wo0t remain unfazed. After the break, Heretics did not allow 100 Thieves back in the game. Wo0t kept the previously mentioned statline, with 22 eliminations compared to 100 Thieves' 20 (excluding eeiu). Boo , meanwhile, had more assists by the end of the series than any player on the opposing team had eliminations. Heretics sealed Sunset 13-1, moving on to the Masters Shanghai top three. The victory means that Heretics will have an opportunity to take revenge against G2 Esports, who have defeated them twice 2-1 in this tournament. “We will just play our game,” Wo0t said after the match. “We're learning; it's good for us,” he added. Heretics will also have the chance to uphold EMEA's trend of winning the second international event of the year. Should they win, they will join Gambit Esports , FunPlus Phoenix , and FNATIC as EMEA Masters winners."

They will next play against each other on June 7, with the winner keeping their trophy hopes alive and advancing to the top three at the event. Their 2-1 victory over Paper Rex means 100 Thieves extend their stay at Masters Shanghai, the first international event the organization has qualified to since Champions 2022. Their in-game leader, Boostio , remains the only player at the event with an international title to his name, but he has a long way to go if he wishes to repeat this feat. Team Heretics, meanwhile, continue their dominance over FUT Esports with the third 2-0 victory against them this year. One EMEA team remains, as Heretics seek redemption for the region and themselves after a disappointing Masters Madrid . 100 Thieves send Paper Rex home with 2-1 win The day started off with a triple kill from bang , which gave his team the pistol round on Breeze, their map pick. Along with Cryocells , they gave the team an early lead, their entrying and multikills helping win an additional seven rounds in the first half. The map continued in similar fashion, as Paper Rex were only able to win one more round in the second half. In the end, X managed to close out the map 13-5 in 100 Thieves' favor. Map two was Paper Rex's opportunity to stay in the game. Sunset, their map pick, started with an early lead for the Southeast Asian squad. f0rsakeN led the charge on their attack, finding 21 eliminations and six assists by the end of the half. After a six-round lead, 100 Thieves were able to adapt to their opponents, but only managed to win four rounds on defense. They continued to win rounds, however, eventually closing the gap and forcing a timeout from Paper Rex. Boostio denied a 1v3 from something to grant his team the lead, setting the score 10-9. 100 Thieves called their own timeout after two rounds from Paper Rex, but they were unable to break through their opponent's defense. After a couple of impressive rounds from something and Jinggg , a double sniper setup shutdown 100 Thieves' final attempt, closing out the map 13-10. The final map, Icebox, would define the outcome of the series. After 100 Thieves went up 4-0 on defense, Paper Rex had hopes of a comeback. They were able to win two rounds, with something netting a four kill to start round 7. Recognizing their advantage, they called a rotate to A, but Asuna was able to find two before the spike was planted. Paper Rex looked to take a quick 2v1 to prevent Asuna from getting into site, but he lined his opponents up and closed out the round with a quadruple of his own. Asuna recovers the round The match continued with a back-and-forth, but the lead for 100 Thieves was too much to overcome. In the end, eeiu ended the half with a 2v1, with the score at 7-5 in his team's favor by half time. A pistol and anti-eco win from Paper Rex tied the score, but 100 Thieves were able to identify and exploit the opposition's weak site to regain their lead with an 11-7. An aggressive round from Paper Rex kicked off a series of round wins to tie the score once again, and the map went on to overtime. The two teams opted for aggressive overtime attacks after initial exploration, but in the end 100 Thieves sealed the map 14-12, advancing to the top four for the first time since Masters Berlin in 2021. “This was definitely one of the most intense games we've ever played,” Cryocells said after the match. “Everyone on the team believes we should win this tournament. We're all feeling super confident.” Team Heretics win EMEA matchup 2-0 The second elimination match of the day started on FUT Esports' map pick, Bind. After the teams traded rounds at the beginning of the half, FUT were able to pull ahead and earn a 6-4 lead. Heretics were not left behind, as benjyfishy and RieNs helped their team close the gap by halftime, denying a clutch from AtaKaptan and securing rounds via their anchoring. In contrast, the second half was anything but close. Heretics were dominant the remainder of the map, only losing one round. After winning Bind, neilzinho mentioned they left the map open knowing FUT would pick it. “Last night [ against G2 ], we took a risk by playing our permaban, but we knew if we banned Bind FUT would pick it today,” he stated. “The previous comp wasn't working,” he added, “so we decided to prep a few days ago just for this.” The dominance continued into map two, as Heretics shut down any idea FUT had on their offense. Despite allowing them to plant six times in the half, Heretics were still able to turn rounds around thanks to their trading and practiced retakes. FUT, meanwhile, were only able to win three rounds before the break: a thrifty, the following anti-eco, and snowballing an out of place defensive push from Heretics. Boo contributes to the scoreboard with a 4k After halftime, FUT won the pistol round, but were defeated the next round after their mistimed peeks were punished by Heretics. The momentum continued from that point, Heretics' reads and individual skill pushing them over the line to finish the map 13-4. With these victories, 100 Thieves have returned to the top four at an international event for the first time since September 2021. The top four finish is Team Heretics' best performance at a Masters tournament, an improvement over their first-ever international event earlier this year, Masters Madrid. As for the losing teams, FUT are also ending with their highest placement at an international event, but this is Paper Rex's worst finish since LOCK//IN."

A close fought 2-0 helped GENG take down their second straight top seed. TH looked completely dominant against G2 up until the moment it all fell apart. An 11-2 G2 comeback completely melted the Europeans' resistance. GENG stun 100T Both GENG and 100T won their opening playoff matchups, but their wins came in very different fashions. Whereas 100T completely obliterated FUT, GENG had to struggle through a 70 round barnburner to sneak past FNATIC. After banning three different maps first in their three playoff matches, GENG's lack of a permaban gave them the freedom to add a fourth opening ban to the list. They got rid of Bind, a map which 100T have dominated all year. GENG immediately showed that they were actually going to challenge 100T unlike FUT. They took very aggressive fights all over the place on their Icebox defense. Lakia got so many kills against pistols that he had his ultimate ready to use in round three. He outkilled all of 100T by himself through the first six rounds. Missed chances defined 100T's early struggles. They allowed a trio of t3xture clutches in the first half and gave Karon a 4K clutch to start the second half. A Munchkin ace pushed GENG's lead to 11-3 before 100T finally woke up. Antieco hero. A 100T comeback was boosted by GENG's failed attempt to break a defensive Lockdown from Boostio. Four players got detained, throwing away one of their last chances to mess with 100T's economy. Seven rounds in a row pulled 100T within one round of tying the game at 11. A timeout from GENG finally shook them out of it, and they took the map 13-10. Karon led the way with 24 kills. His 3-0 opening duel record helped with GENG's critical +9 opening kill differential. Ascent started nearly as poorly for 100T. Throughout the first six rounds, the North American squad only managed to win an eco round. Despite the power of Ascent defense, they couldn't manage to repel GENG's site hits. It was only when GENG tried playing around mid that 100T found their footing. Back-to-back multikills from bang in Market kicked off another 100T run. They turned a four round deficit into a one round lead before entering the half tied. A wild sequence kicked off the final half of the series. 100T won the pistol, but a Sheriff 4K from t3xture sent them right back down to an eco round. They won that eco round, but GENG returned with yet another eco round victory to stuff any momentum. 100T played almost exclusively on the extremities of the map during their attack. Very rarely did a player touch mid while the round was still winnable. GENG had a stranglehold on the main chokepoints, and quickly jumped to map and match point. They took the map with another 13-10 despite t3xture forgetting to buy a gun in the final round. It was a great win for a GENG squad that took down yet another top seed in a difficult environment. Their recent form is all the more impressive because of the illness spreading through their team and keeping them from the handshake line. With the win, they set themselves up for a second straight top-three finish internationally. TH collapse against G2 G2 and TH were familiar foes after facing off in the Swiss Stage. In that match, G2 took down TH to qualify for the playoffs in the only match Wo0t has gone negative all tournament thus far. This time, TH decided to allow their permaban, Ascent, through the veto.They also gambled by picking Icebox first. The map was one of G2's favorites in the Americas, but they did look rough when they played it against T1 in the Swiss Stage. G2 decided to switch up their agent composition on Icebox. They replaced Omen with Sage for some extra defensive stopping power and spike control. Unfortunately for them, their extremely slow style found very few openings to get into advantageous post-plants despite the Sage utility. TH ran out to an 11-2 lead with ease. When they went aggressive, they won fast. When they played passively, they forced G2 into a late round time crunch as they tried to plant. This is benjyfishy's ocean. A force buy after the second pistol loss gave G2 a chance. They converted that round and a few more after that, but there is no world where TH would fail to convert an 11-2 lead… this map. G2 eventually fell 13-7. Every single member of TH finished with at least as many kills as the top performer from G2. At the top of the scoreboard was benjyfishy with an absurd 28-6 scoreline. TH's gamble on Ascent appeared to be paying off when they replicated their Icebox performance. G2's attack once again looked lifeless. TH got another ten rounds first half off the back of an 18 kill slaughter by Wo0t. After losing the second pistol to go down 11-2, G2 were once again faced with a force buy to keep them alive. Even once they won the round, they were still in just as big of a hole as they were on Icebox. However, defense on Ascent is a completely different beast than Icebox. With their backs against a wall, G2 won round after round. JonahP and trent kept the sites on lockdown against TH's attack. In particular, trent wreaked havoc with an Odin that TH could never uproot from B. Wo0t managed just two kills in the second half as G2 won 11 rounds in a row for the 13-11 victory. On the other side, trent got 19 of his map leading 27 kills in the second half. The mental effects of throwing such a massive lead seemed to bite TH on the final map. G2 took the fight to them from the starting gun and never looked back. Good ideas meet good execution. A 3K clutch from benjyfishy threatened to keep G2 from running away with things on Lotus, but he and the rest of his team couldn't follow it up with any other hero plays. G2 only reached an 8-4 lead in the half, but the game already felt over, especially considering they were switching onto the attack of the most attacker sided map in the game. With the tides completely turned, G2 finished off their opponents 13-4. JonahP finished with more kills (28) than the bottom four TH players combined (27). Despite the collapse, TH still showed tremendous upside. They nearly blew out G2 to reach a guaranteed top three placement at an international LAN while playing with a substitute player. After a long and difficult road through Ascension in the Americas and very nearly being denied their slot, this G2 roster is now approaching the crest of the tallest competitive hill in Valorant. They still have another year on their Ascension contracts, but they don't want to waste time. With limited opportunities for success, they have accelerated straight to contender status. Coming Up 100T fell to the lower bracket where they will have another matchup with a Pacific squad. This time they will battle PRX to determine the only top seed to escape the bottom of the playoff standings. TH will battle FUT in a regional rematch to determine the last EMEA team left in the event. Banner image by Liu YiCun/Riot Games."

FUT Esports and Paper Rex will stay alive in the lower bracket, one loss away from elimination. FUT Esports get revenge on Fnatic This battle was between the top seed and third seed from EMEA, who both lost in the first round of the Masters Shanghai playoffs. These two teams faced each other recently at the EMEA Stage 1 playoffs, where Fnatic beat FUT Esports in the lower bracket final 3-1 . The map veto began with FUT picking Split and Fnatic picking Lotus, leaving Ascent as the decider. Fnatic started the series with Derke on Yoru and Alfajer on Raze. FUT went with cNed on Chamber and qRaxs moving from his traditional initiator to Raze. The first pistol for Split went to Fnatic, as Derke removed cNed seconds into the game. Fnatic nearly converted their bonus, but qRaxs sniped a 3K to secure the round win. The double duelist of Yoru and Raze oppressed any attempts FUT had to walk on sites and took advantage when FUT played slow. FUT would often die first, however their post-plants were successful when they moved onto the site. Rounds went back and forth, with Fnatic entering the half up 7-5. Derke lurked to win Fnatic their second pistol round after they lost the first duel. The double duelist was more valuable on the Fnatic attack side, as they converted the bonus round to go up 10-5. Chronicle got a kill with his tripwire, which was the ultimate death blow, ending Fnatic's attack half perfectly at 13-5. FUT stuck with their new Lotus comp featuring Breach instead of their no-initiator comp that they had run regionally, while Fnatic ran their default comp. Fnatic missed some simple shots on pistols to go down early. Back on Jett, cNed picked up a Vandal on round two to help make his start easy. FUT converted their bonus as AtaKaptan got four kills in the round, validating the risky rifle purchase on their anti-eco. FUT started frequently pushing the C site, allowing yetujey to lurk and create openings for FUT to exploit. Map control defined the half for FUT when they took a 9-3 lead. The top seed from EMEA won the second pistol round, cutting into the lead from FUT. Both AtaKaptan and MrFaliN , the two controllers for FUT, shut down a late push on C to prevent a Fnatic bonus conversion. AtaKaptan and yetujey stopped all the A-site pushes Fnatic often attempted, while the Breach utility slowed Fnatic enough to make their attack painful if they went anywhere else. Fnatic were able to string together a run when they were down 12-5, but the attempt was a fake comeback in the end. cNed bought an operator on the final round and cleverly avoided the Fade eye from Leo , sniping Alfajer early. FUT won map two 13-8 to take the series to Ascent. Leo celebrates a round win for Fnatic at Masters Shanghai. (Image via Riot Games) Ascent was the first mirror matchup of the series, so it came down to who played better on their respective agents. Derke and cNed were the highlighted Jett duel, and the Turkish Jett helped FUT win the first pistol round. Perhaps the most improved player from the previous two maps was qRaxs, back on his signature KAY/O for the first time in the series. He was crucial to the bonus conversion from FUT, killing Boaster through an enemy one-way while on low health. Leo had to use Hunter's Fury to clutch round five and win Fnatic their first round on Ascent. Fighting back to keep the lead, cNed used the Outlaw and an aggressive defensive push up catwalk to win a round and force a timeout. Derke then used his Jett knives to surprise FUT on their save round, which was followed up by a traditional cNed Operator pickup to stop Fnatic in their tracks. Fnatic had to put all of their hope in a strong defense to keep their tournament going, as FUT entered the half up 9-3. The second pistol win for FUT was defined by flanks. Fnatic took space on their defense, yet the awareness from yetujey and MrFaliN net them free kills from behind. FUT's confidence built to the point that yetujey tried to jump and knife kill Derke from around a corner, showing no fear to the two-time international champs. Ascent was the most one-sided map of the series; FUT won 13-3 and eliminated Fnatic. Fnatic were unable to win a single series at Masters Shanghai, despite earning a bye to the playoff round after winning Stage 1 in EMEA. FUT Esports, the third seed from EMEA, will stay alive alongside the victor of Paper Rex versus EDward Gaming . Paper Rex sent EDG on a short trip home For this series, EDward Gaming picked Bind and Paper Rex picked Sunset, leaving Split as the potential third map. Paper Rex began Bind with a curveball as something pulled out the Reyna pick. ZmjjKK quickly snapped onto two heads on the pistol before shooting his way to a 4K on round two. Rounds went by quickly, with Paper Rex either planting or dying in what felt like seconds. The pace was more comfortable for Paper Rex, who used both their skill in quick play and some luck to take a 6-2 lead. Smoggy and nobody teamed up to shut down a B hit from Paper Rex and stop the bleeding on round eight. In a chaotic round soon after, something dodged what seemed like a guaranteed death but Smoggy clutched the 1v1, defusing the spike with less than half a second remaining. The two consecutive rounds pulled the half back for EDG, ending the half tied at 6-6. Paper Rex regained the lead due to a Jinggg Frenzy 4K, winning the second pistol round. EDG bought ZmjjKK a Bulldog on the next round despite losing the pistol to try and surprise Paper Rex, yet f0rsakeN saved Paper Rex from a potential thrifty loss. The gambit hurt the Paper Rex economy enough to mix up their plans to start the half. As EDG tied it 8-8, Paper Rex won another lucky round as something got two Guardian wallbang kills in what seemed like an easy EDG round win. The win was crucial for the Paper Rex economy as well, keeping the teams on an even footing. The EDG focus shifted to quick splits and avoiding any duels with something, leading to another tie at 10-10. Someone had to step up to win the map for their team, and that hero was f0rsakeN. In the next four rounds, he was the focal point. The two best moments were a strong B defense with his Harbor utility, and then killing three on A site the round after to help Paper Rex avoid overtime and win Bind 13-11.

Starting on the attack, EDG won the first pistol off of a smart Haodong play to secure a 2v3 post plant. Paper Rex then started to run away with the half after winning their first rifle round. The team focused on getting something the Operator, which secured plenty of first kills across the map. Moving from initiator to sentinel, d4v41 on Sage slowed down any attempted aggression from EDG as Paper Rex built their lead. A thrifty from EDG stole a round back to keep a comeback within reach, but they still entered the half down 8-4. mindfreak got two kills in a tough spot to win Paper Rex the second pistol round. On attack, the Breach, Gekko, and Raze allowed for plenty of pace changes. One round Paper Rex waited for EDG to push and picked them apart, while the next would be a rush on B site with a Wingman plant and a Sage wall. EDG struggled to read Paper Rex and took too long on retakes. Paper Rex closed out the map 13-6, sweeping the local favorites out of Masters Shanghai. The top seed from Pacific will face the loser of G2 Esports versus Team Heretics , while FUT Esports will face the loser from 100 Thieves versus Gen.G ."

G2 fought through a three-map series over Paper Rex while Heretics crushed EDward Gaming in a clean 2-0 . G2 had a clean run through the Swiss stage with a 2-0 record while Heretics narrowly squeaked past FunPlus Phoenix in the 2-1 pool. Today's winners will face off in the upper bracket semifinals on Sunday, June 2. Heretics will hope to change up their game plan following a disappointing showing against G2 in the Swiss stage. Paper Rex and EDG will face off in a do-or-die elimination series tomorrow. G2 2-1 Paper Rex to pick up opener G2 picked Split to start the series, followed by PRX picking Lotus, leaving Bind as the decider. Split began in a flash with a pistol round that lasted less than 30 seconds as PRX flattened the B-site defense from G2. An early 1v2 4K from something in the bonus gave PRX all the momentum they needed for the first half. PRX's signature aggressive style completely rolled over G2's stagnant defense as the Americans were incapable of taking space early in the round against something's attacking Operator. The Pacific champs collected 11 rounds in a row before G2 achieved their only round of the half. A G2 pistol and back-to-back 1v1s from JonahP extended the game for a moment before a solid A retake from PRX ended the map 13-7. Jinggg 's return to the international stage went splendidly as the Singaporean collected 21 kills with 207 ADR before the series began to go downhill for PRX. something was crucial on Split. G2 got off to a much better start on Lotus with a pistol win and a bonus round conversion before a Showstopper team kill from icy combined with a d4v41 Sheriff 3K to give PRX a way back into the game. PRX didn't let the opportunity go to waste by following up with six straight rounds propelled by a something 1v2 in round seven . G2's game plan of waiting for PRX's constant attempts at pushing brought them two more rounds to end the half at an even 6-6. A valyn 4K gifted G2 their second pistol in the map and the following momentum pushed G2 through a bonus round conversion to take the lead at 10-6. PRX repeatedly failed to clear close corners on their attack side, giving over opening picks and match point to G2 at 12-7. A something 1v4 led PRX to a string of three rounds before G2 closed out the second map at 13-10 to force a third map. icy's upswing in form following the regular season continued as the rookie picked up 22 kills and 164 ADR to even the series. something's 1v4 gave PRX a chance to get back into things. Bind looked like a complete reversal of Split for G2. The game plan was perfect against PRX as the favorites got just two rounds while G2 sped their way to a near-perfect half. The entire team was performing excellently with G2 picking up a 10-2 half on the attack. trent went 6-0 in opening duels to allow G2 to dominate the early engagements. PRX appeared dejected in the second half as G2's lead enabled them to cruise to a 13-5 map win and a 2-1 series victory. The quartet of icy, trent, valyn, and leaf dominated the server with all four claiming higher than 150 ADR and 200 ACS. G2's teamplay was excellent. G2 will face Team Heretics on Sunday, June 2 in a rematch from round two of the Swiss stage. Paper Rex have been relegated to the lower bracket and will face off against EDG tomorrow . Heretics ease past EDward Gaming The map veto resulted in Heretics opting to first pick Sunset followed by EDG picking Split and leaving Breeze as the decider. Heretics got off to a great start on Sunset with a Wo0t 4K in the pistol and a bonus round conversion to go up 4-0 before EDG could pick up their first. Heretics looked incredibly comfortable on their map pick. Sunset has proven to be Heretic's best map thus far in 2024 with an 80% win rate. EDG managed to come back slightly towards the end of the half with two rounds in a row thanks to some sharp shots from ZmjjKK to end the half at 8-4. EDG managed to pick up the second pistol to close the gap to just two rounds before Heretics ran away with the rest of the map. Heretics took the map comfortably 13-6 with strong performances across the board. Wo0t continued a strong streak of form in the duelist position with 198 ADR and 21 kills. Heretics opened up Split with Wo0t and paTiTek swapping roles after their lacklustre match against G2. Wo0t was placed back onto Raze duty after temporarily swapping to Viper in their previous showing. The swap seemed to provide instant value with Wo0t picking up an important opening kill to claim the pistol for Heretics. EDG could not handle the mid-rounding from Heretics that enabled frequent site stacks throughout the half. Wo0t racked up repeated multikills while benjyfishy's A site remained impervious. A 10-2 half and a pistol win for Heretics all but sealed the game for the Europeans as the home team mustered just a single round in the second half. Heretics eased past Split 13-3 to pick up the series in a clean 2-0. Wo0t's Raze has been a shining light for Heretics. Heretics have moved to the upper bracket semifinals and will play G2 on Sunday, June 2. EDG have been relegated to the lower bracket and will face off against Paper Rex in an elimination series tomorrow."

    "cleaned_content": "100 Thieves beat FUT Esports and Gen.G beat FNATIC on the first day of the Masters Shanghai playoffs. 100 Thieves and Gen.G moved on in the upper bracket of the playoffs, while FUT Esports and Fnatic were sent to the lower bracket. Fans got to see the first games of both 100 Thieves and Fnatic, the respective first seeds from Americas and EMEA. 100 Thieves were nothing but dominant in their match against FUT Esports, while Fnatic were the first regional one-seed to lose at Masters Shanghai. 100 Thieves speedrun through FUT Esports The map veto began with FUT picking Icebox and 100 Thieves picking Bind, leaving Ascent as the potential third map. On Icebox, the only difference between the two teams was the choice of the second initiator. Asuna chose Gekko, while qRaxs chose KAY/O. 100 Thieves won the first pistol round thanks to a smart read, expecting FUT to push up tube. Cryocells then got an Operator on their bonus round, using it to get two clean headshots and a bonus round conversion. Cryo was the key factor early in the game as 100T cycled him around the map. Duels constantly went in favor of 100T, forcing early fights when FUT were scaling. Even when FUT funneled the Operator to cNed and got the pick against Cryo, other players on 100 Thieves stepped up to prevent any easy site takes. Fut struggled until round nine to simply plant the spike, needing to invest both Viper and Killjoy ultimate to seal their first round win. 100 Thieves either sniped early picks that made their defense easier or forced out so much utility from FUT that they could not plant or protect the spike. 100 Thieves entered the half up 11-1; a near-perfect defense half from the Americas top seed. FUT won the second pistol on Icebox with some snappy Sherriff shots from cNed, but 100 Thieves stole a win on their eco round. Boostio snuck past all of the Killjoy utility from FUT in kitchen and killed both cNed and AtaKaptan on B site, delivering two guns to his team and the thrifty win. The map ended 13-2; a stomp in favor of 100 Thieves. Asuna, from 100 Thieves. (Image via Riot Games) The teams went with significantly different comps on Bind, with both teams opting for different initiators and a different secondary controller. 100 Thieves won the first pistol round, with Asuna getting a lucky flank around FUT to secure a 2v2 win. The defense continued to be strong for 100 Thieves, as they used the Fade seize and Brimstone ultimate to lock two enemies into guaranteed death just as FUT got their first rifle buy of the half. Cryo ended up ulting his teammate Boostio a couple of rounds later, but the team laughed the moment away. Despite moving from Jett to Brimstone, Cryo maintained his form from map one. In back-to-back rounds, he was crucial in converting what looked like losing scenarios. This was where the strategy change from Icebox shone through. For Icebox, 100 Thieves would hold FUT back from even getting onto the site. On Bind, they emphasized retakes instead. FUT took a couple of rounds with the space that 100 Thieves tactically gave up, entering the half down 8-4. Cryo was the key reason 100 Thieves had the lead on Bind defense. He had 24 kills for the first half, which was more kills than any player had on Icebox earlier in this series. 100 Thieves went aggressive on their second pistol win of the map, putting FUT on comeback watch. A bonus conversion from 100T effectively ended the half, and by extension, the series. Bind ended 13-5 for 100 Thieves, making this a quick sweep for the top Americas team heading into Shanghai. The entire match took only an hour and a half, including breaks at halftime and between maps. Gen.G grind out win over Fnatic The map veto began with Gen.G picking Lotus and Fnatic picking Bind, leaving Breeze as the potential third map. Gen.G started the map with a pistol win, as Meteor showed off his skills with the Sherriff. Both teams then traded thrifty clutches – first a Sherriff 1v1 win from Derke , then a Lakia 3K clutch. Fnatic ended up winning more of those close rounds as the half went on. Leo and Alfajer looked just as impeccable as they had at the EMEA Stage 1 finals, and the rest of the team played off of the momentum those two created. Fnatic ended their defense up 9-3. Munchkin battled his way to a 4K on the second pistol round to give Gen.G life. On their bonus round, t3xture snapped two kills on rubble to get the win. Gen.G secured early picks often, which led to Fnatic attempting to save weapons multiple rounds in a row. Those saves failed, as Gen.G hunted Fnatic down each time to remove those weapons and hurt their economy. Broken buys led to a 10-10 tie, but Fnatic then forced Gen.G to make some egregious mistakes. Normally one of the best Operator players in the world, t3xture was caught out multiple times trying to position onto aggressive angles. Fnatic played very slowly, getting the timings needed to punish t3xture and regain their lead. The comeback hope ended as quickly as it began, as Fnatic closed the map out 13-10. There was a near-mirror matchup between the two squads on Bind. The only difference was that Gen.G opted for Cypher while Fnatic ran the Gekko. Gen.G won their third straight pistol round thanks to a tense ranged Frenzy 1v1 from Karon . As the rifle rounds began, Fnatic struggled against the slow style of Gen.G. Fnatic lost early attack rounds to overthinking, teleporting constantly to no avail. After taking a timeout, Karon got a 3K on low health to ruin what looked like a good post-plant for Fnatic. A hero 3K from Alfajer redeemed another potential lost round, as Fnatic used that win to start performing better as a team. Gen.G had a 5-1 lead, but Fnatic pulled it back to a 6-6 tie. Fnatic hustled their way into their first pistol win of the series in the second half of Bind. Alfajer landed a 4K, fully cementing his takeover as the rounds were traded back and forth. Fnatic looked to be pulling away until an unfavorable trade B long and a bad ultimate from Derke allowed Gen.G to take the 11-9 lead. The Fnatic heroics faded away, as Gen.G won Bind 13-10 and took the series to Breeze. Lakia and Gen.G celebrate a round win versus Fnatic. (Image via Riot Games) Ending on Breeze, both teams ran Yoru with different intent. Gen.G ran double duelist with t3xture on Jett, allowing for Yoru to push aggressively and take space on site; Fnatic ran double initiator, allowing Yoru to both function as duelist and initiator due to his multiple flashes. Gen.G won the first pistol round due to an early pick from t3xture and a tense but successful defuse. Meteor and t3xture earned some early kills on the bonus round and converted, but Fnatic followed it up with a thrifty win, sparking a five-round run from Fnatic as they pulled apart the double-duelist defense. Fnatic entered the half up 7-5. Gen.G now moved onto their attack side, where their planned Yoru site executes could catch enemies off guard. Fnatic took the second pistol round on Breeze off of an aggressive defensive push that caught Karon off guard. Though Fnatic failed to convert their bonus, Munchkin made a crucial error the round after to lose to another thrifty. The end of the map was defined by Gen.G winning gun rounds, then losing when Fnatic had worse weaponry. Tied 11-11, Gen.G cleaned up their act and planned some fancy set plays to push onto B site. Gen.G used Yoru clone to find trips, Sova dart to spot enemies, then a teleport to get deep into site along with an Astra smoke to hide safely in. When it mattered most, Gen.G constructed their best attack rounds of the game. Gen.G won the map 13-11, and the series 2-1. With this win, Gen.G will face 100 Thieves next in the upper bracket semifinals. Fnatic will fight off against regional rivals FUT Esports for their Masters Shanghai lives in the lower bracket."

    "cleaned_content": "Team Heretics and FUT Esports have eliminated FunPlus Phoenix and LEVIATÁN from Masters Shanghai. With these wins, Team Heretics and FUT Esports have secured their spot in the playoffs of Masters Shanghai. Team Heretics scrap out close win over FPX The map veto began with Team Heretics picking Sunset and FPX picking Lotus, leaving Icebox as the potential third map. FPX ran Yoru and Harbor, two picks that they loved to run across most maps in the pool. Heretics ran their Shanghai standard, with benjyfishy on the Cypher and Wo0t on the Raze. After winning the first pistol, Heretics started to get a lead thanks to an ace from Wo0t. FPX fumbled some rounds as well, notably using a Yoru ultimate in a 3v2 to spot both enemies and still losing. Heretics had solid plans for their post-plants and were able to play around the Harbor utility well. The lead ballooned to 10-1 until a 1v2 clutch from autumn took FPX into the half down 10-2. A second pistol round loss for FPX proved too big a deficit to come back from, as Team Heretics cleaned up map one 13-4. Wo0t was the star on map one, with his aggression helping him get 27 kills in only 17 rounds. Wo0t celebrates a round win at Masters Shanghai. (Image via Riot Games) Lotus was next, with FPX returning to their triple controller comp. Life got a quick 4K to get his team their first pistol win of the series, and a bonus conversion set FPX off to a needed hot start. It took some eco round wins for Team Heretics to stop the bleeding, who fought back to enter the half only down 8-4. FPX won a second pistol due to some key indecision from Heretics and maintained their momentum from their attack side to finish the map 13-6. Icebox was the second time FPX ran triple controller this series, with Life moving onto the newest agent Clove. Starting on attack, Team Heretics got their first pistol win of Icebox thanks to a good post-plant on B site. Heretics looked drilled, constantly aware of how FPX played their defense with Clove. Life usually pushed alone near A site, and it would often be read by Heretics for a free kill. That led to Heretics converting their first bonus round, already putting FPX in a tough spot. It took a thrifty for FPX to get their first defense round win to put them on the board at 5-1. They entered the half down 10-2 for the second time this series, once again needing a miracle to bring their playoff chances back. Life was able to get a 4K to win the second pistol round of Icebox, but a clutch defuse from Heretics prevented an FPX bonus conversion. The triple controller allowed for some creative attack rounds, especially in mid, that helped mount a comeback. AAAAY and Autumn hit some big shots, taking the map to overtime. FPX had all the momentum coming back from a 10-2 deficit, but to win the series, they would need to win a defense round. The first attempt was a loss, but winning the attack round gave them another chance. The second try was another defense loss and attack win, owing to a BerLIN clutch flank through the enemy spawn. The third overtime was the third round across the entire map that FPX had won a defense round, this time from an opening kill from Life and a clutch late flank from BerLIN once again. But on attack, Wo0t sliced his way to an ace with his Jett ultimate and took the map to a fourth overtime. Just as the map seemed within reach for FPX, they lost the final round due to a chaotic moment. FPX had to plant in a 1v1, with just over four seconds left, but an audible drop from Boo got BerLIN off the spike, and the FPX player could not see his enemy in their own Clove smoke. Team Heretics scraped out the win to beat FPX 17-15. FUT Esports eliminate Leviatán thanks to a dominant Sunset This was the matchup between the third seeds of EMEA and Americas where both teams were known for their great individual talent. While FUT Esports had lost to FPX and only beat Dragon Ranger Gaming , Leviatán had stomped T1 and lost a close game to Gen.G . Leviatán looked in prime position to lock up the final playoff spot, but FUT proved otherwise. The map veto began with Leviatán picking Sunset and FUT picking Lotus, leaving Bind as the potential third map. On their map pick, Leviatán struggled to start the series. FUT won the first pistol, converted their bonus, and just picked up momentum. The teams ran mirrored comps, but qRaxs on Gekko and yetujey on Cypher performed a step above their counterparts on Leviatán. It took until the final round of the first half for Leviatán to win their first round, heading into the half down 11-1. FUT won their second pistol and their anti-eco round, securing the map 13-1 before Leviatán even played a proper gun round on their attack side. qRaxs ended the map with 19 kills, four first kills, no first deaths, and 349 ACS. To stay alive in the series, Leviatán had to beat FUT on Lotus. FUT changed their comp from what they ran regionally, picking up Breach when they previously ran no initiator with a Sage. FUT won their third straight pistol of the series, but Leviatán took hold of their attack half as soon as they got rifles in their hands. Specifically, kiNgg had one of his maps where he had the best aim in the lobby. Leviatán looked strong despite losing the pistol round, heading into the half with a 7-5 lead. They managed to win the second pistol round on Lotus, and Leviatán reached map point up 12-6 thanks to aspas getting frequent first kills, ending the map with seven. FUT started to claw back the map due to players rising to the challenge, with both yetujey and cNed having their star moments. That sparked the team and took the map to 12-11 when kiNgg saved a round that looked like a guaranteed win for FUT and secured the map 13-11. Bind began with Leviatán winning the first pistol round, with aspas finally turning up in a series he had been relatively quiet in. Leviatán went up 6-1, but then FUT took five straight rounds to tie the half thanks to flash utility from Omen, Skye, and KAY/O. With those flash setups, AtaKaptan on Omen was able to get plenty of kills on blinded opponents. FUT celebrate their match win over Leviatán at Masters Shanghai. (Image via Riot Games) FUT won the second pistol round on Bind and converted the bonus to put the pressure on Leviatán. Despite a weakened economy after winning the round after losing their bonus, FUT still had plenty of utility to assist their retakes. Mazino led the team in, landing key shots and assisting for easy plants, but the rest of Leviatán struggled to follow up post-plant. Round 18 was the turning point, as a Leviatán 5v4 post-plant with Viper ultimate crumbled into a round loss. FUT were now the team to reach map point, and the chances for Leviatán to stretch the game to overtime ran out on round 24. Despite worse weapons, FUT clutched out to win the map 13-11 and the series 2-1. The playoff section of Masters Shanghai begins on May 30, with all teams having a two-day break. Due to the new format, with number one seeds choosing their opponents, Team Heretics will face EDward Gaming on playoffs day one, while FUT Esports will face 100 Thieves on playoffs day two."

    "cleaned_content": "In a relatively quick four-map day, T1 and Dragon Ranger Gaming became the first teams eliminated from Masters Shanghai . LEVIATÁN dominated T1, and FUT Esports squeaked by DRG to qualify to the deciding round of the Swiss stage. LEV roll over T1 Both LEV and T1 lost in the opening round of the Swiss stage to teams that reached the playoffs in 2-0 fashion. One of the third seeds from the Americas and Pacific regions would go home having only ever faced teams from their counterpart's region. T1 tripped and fell flat on their face right out of the gate. They gave up the first six rounds in a row on their Breeze attack after tex and kiNgg landed back-to-back 1v2 clutches. It took an eco win to get them on the board. Unfortunately for them, they only managed two more rounds in the half when Sayaplayer bailed them out with 1v2 clutches of his own. What a shot. It was a bit of a struggle for LEV to close the map. T1 took the first three rounds, and LEV had to win an eco round to keep their defense from spiraling out of control. The LATAM squad failed to string together any gun rounds, but they did manage to reach a 13-9 conclusion. Mazino bounced back from an underwhelming performance against GENG with 24 kills in 24 rounds. T1's double duelist dive comp struggled to control space around the map, and iZu's Yoru finished with four more deaths than anyone else on the server. T1 mixed up their agent comp heading into Sunset. They decided to pick up Sage over the near-ubiquitous Cypher, and they rotated iZu onto duelist instead of Sayaplayer. For the third straight time, a team won the bonus round when LEV jumped to a 3-0 start on their defense. This first half was even more dominant than the last one. LEV waltzed to a 10-2 lead with ease. T1 finally became the first team to lose a bonus after they won the final pistol round of the series. It was only a matter of time before their meager resistance slipped away. A 13-7 final score sent them back to Korea. LEV were in form today. The Sayaplayer Gekko experiment did not work at all. He finished with a disastrous 5-18 statline, and xccurate and carpe were close behind him. iZu did perform on Raze, but it was outclassed by yet another dominating showing from aspas and his 23-10 statline. This series ended C0M's streak of 11 straight matches without going positive. The last two times he went positive were his first game with LEV and his world championship crowning. His return to form provided a nice boost to LEV's momentum in this event. FUT survive DRG Somewhat surprisingly, FUT picked Bind first, a map that was tied for their worst record and DRG's best this year. It was a mainstay of their success in previous years, and they showed why in a win against DRG. DRG swapped Harbor in place of the Viper pick that they and most other teams were opting for all year. Typically, the teams that choose Harbor on Bind replace the Brimstone instead. Initially, it looked like this series was going to be even more one sided than the previous one. FUT stormed out to a 6-0 and then 8-1 lead without a single DRG player finding individual success. It wasn't until the final three rounds of the half that DRG showed signs of life. Saved. Down 8-4, DRG mounted a comeback, finally making a map close for the first time all day. They won the pistol and extended it through yet another bonus round win. With the map getting away from them, FUT stemmed the bleeding with an eco round win. A late surge from DRG couldn't quite close the gap, and FUT took the map 13-10. TvirusLuke led the server with 23 kills, ten more than he had gotten all series against Heretics. Ascent started much the same way as Bind. FUT won their defensive pistol and ran out to a 6-0 start. However, once again, DRG battled back into the game. FUT's retakes were dominating, so DRG moved to aggressively take the fight to them in the postplant. DRG fought back for five rounds in the half, a very acceptable scoreline attacking on Ascent. These kind of plays faded down the stretch for FUT. FUT won the second-half pistol, but DRG stopped the snowball by winning the anti-bonus for just the second time in eight tries all day. Both teams battled back and forth, tying the game at ten, 11, and 12 rounds each. In overtime, DRG finally ran out of gas, and FUT took the series with a 14-12 victory. cNed and qRaxs each ended up with 29 kills to 17 deaths. Across the series, nizhaoTZH's 45 kills led his team with TvirusLuke and vo0kashu right behind him, but their firepower wasn't enough to lead to DRG's first international win. Despite AtaKaptan struggling with just 21 kills and an 0-7 first kill record, FUT stayed alive to fight another day. Coming Up The matchups for the deciding round have been drawn. FUT will face LEV while the two teams that lost in the winners matches, Heretics and FPX, will match up tomorrow. The winners of those matches will move on to the playoffs. The four teams already qualified to the playoffs from winning their regional titles will draw for positions, then pick their opponents out of the four teams that qualified through the Swiss stage. There is a two-day gap between the Swiss stage and the playoffs. Banner image by David Lee/Riot Games."

    "cleaned_content": "Gen.G and G2 Esports are the first two teams to make the playoffs in Shanghai from the Swiss stage with wins over FunPlus Phoenix and Team Heretics . Gen.G survive FPX scare Gen.G are the first team to make the playoffs in Shanghai after narrowly edging out FPX in a three-map affair. Both teams traded map picks with FPX denying a Gen.G comeback in triple overtime after being up 10-2 at halftime. The decider required every round of regulation before Gen.G took the series away from a promising FPX. Gen.G came into the series after an impressive win over LEVIATÁN in which they took the final two maps convincingly, while FPX came off the back of their first ever international victory over FUT Esports . The map veto resulted in Gen.G picking the first map, Lotus, followed by FPX picking Sunset, with Ascent as the decider. FPX denied an impressive comeback from Gen.G on Lotus after leading 10-2 in the first half. Following a 1v2 clutch from Autumn in the third round, Life 's attacking Operator and slow defaults from FPX worked brilliantly into Gen.G's setups. A one-sided round from FPX immediately answered any effort from Gen.G to come back into the game. Despite losing the second pistol, Gen.G managed to bring some momentum back into their favor by winning a force in the second round and taking the next eight rounds straight. A strong overall performance from Karon and a reinvigorated t3xture led to Gen.G forcing overtime. FPX started to pick up some defensive rounds once extra time came into play and closed out the map 16-14 to take a lead in the series. Life dropped 30 kills and 281 ACS to continue a streak of good form from the Chinese domestic scene. An excellent performance from Karon kept the map close. Gen.G recovered with a convincing defensive side on Sunset after an even 6-6 first half. Simple executes from Gen.G went unmatched early in the half as the Madrid finalists took a 5-2 lead before FPX responded with some superb set plays to facilitate Life's Yoru. Both pistols and conversions went the way of Gen.G to pave an easy route to Ascent. FPX's lack of a true entry duelist forced slow rounds and lots of pressure towards middle that was handled well by Gen.G. Life's numbers were not enough for FPX this time around as the individuals on Gen.G started to take the upper hand in duels. The opening kills also went heavily in the favor of the Koreans with every player recording a positive opening duel success rate. The trio of t3xture, Karon, and Meteor led the way for Gen.G with over 200 ACS each. While t3xture and Karon continued their form from Lotus, Meteor stepped up into the series after a poor first map. Life continued to excel in the map loss. Gen.G were fully in the driver's seat in the first half of Ascent with FPX's solo Yoru once again hindering their attacking ability. Gen.G adapted well to FPX's slow game plan and insistence on forcing middle control. t3xture's Operator worked wonders for Gen.G with the Korean Jett landing an absurd flick to top it off. FPX struggled even in the round wins and accrued just four rounds before halftime. A pistol win and a ridiculous round from BerLIN brought some energy back to FPX as they kept the score close at 10-8 and forced a Gen.G timeout. Back-and-forth rounds ensued, but Gen.G's existing lead allowed them to narrowly take the map 13-11 and the series 2-1. Meteor went nuclear on Ascent with 31 kills and multiple crucial multikills on Killjoy. Meteor went off on Ascent. Gen.G are the first team to make it out of the Swiss stage in Shanghai, while FPX will have another chance in the 1-1 pool on Monday, May 27. G2 make playoffs with 2-1 over Team Heretics G2 have joined Gen.G as the second team to make the playoffs in Shanghai from the Swiss stage after picking up the second series of the day with a 2-1 over Team Heretics. The Americans had to recover from an initial loss on Lotus but looked comfortable on the remaining maps. G2 barely scraped by T1 to make it into the 1-0 pool, while Heretics had an easy time against Chinese newcomers Dragon Ranger Gaming . The second map veto of the day resulted in Heretics picking the first map, Lotus, followed by Bind from G2, leaving Split as the decider. Lotus kicked off with a G2 pistol and conversion followed by Heretics winning the first two gun rounds. G2 won a thrifty in the sixth round to equalize at 3-3. benjyfishy 's Cypher Operator proved to be the difference maker late in the half as Heretics took a promising 8-4 half on the defense of the attacker-sided Lotus. Heretics went on to pick up the second pistol and went blow for blow with G2 through the remainder of the map. However, the lead ultimately proved to be too much for G2 to overcome as Heretics traded rounds to take the first map 13-9. The assistance of Turkish star Wo0t was unnecessary this time around as the trio of paTiTek , RieNs , and benjyfishy rolled over their opposition with 18 kills on the latter two and 19 on the former. benjyfishy has become a star on Heretics. Although Heretics took the first pistol on Bind, G2 ran away with the first half once the gun rounds properly came into play. G2 looked composed on the attack and took a dominant 9-3 half. A streak of ten rounds in a row for G2 was finally ended by a thrifty win from Heretics to begin an attempt at a comeback, but three rounds were all the Europeans could muster. G2 evened up the series 1-1 with a 13-6 scoreline on Bind. Despite struggling through most of his tenure with G2, icy proved instrumental in his team's dominance on the second map with a server-topping 20 kills and 304 ACS. On the other hand, Wo0t continued a streak of relatively poor form on Raze with just 94 ADR and a 3-6 opening duel record. Split began with an immediate shock with paTiTek playing the Raze for Heretics over Wo0t who was instead placed on Viper duty. Unfortunately, the move didn't bring any success to start the map as G2 blitzed to a 4-0 lead and forced a quick timeout from Heretics coach neilzinho . The break provided little respite for Heretics as another timeout was called just three rounds later after a 1v3 from valyn to make the score 7-0. Heretics managed to cobble together their first round at 8-0 down and despite losing another 1v3, this time to leaf , took the last three of four rounds in the half to make the decider 9-3 at halftime. A G2 pistol win in the second half all but sealed the series as the Americans cruised their way to a 13-8 win with a 1v4 ace from JonahP to close things out. Heretics lost two 1v3s and one 1v4 on Split. G2 have made the playoffs in Shanghai, while Heretics will have another chance in the 1-1 pool on Monday, May 27."

    "cleaned_content": "Gen.G defeated LEVIATÁN 2-1, and Team Heretics swept Dragon Ranger Gaming 2-0 in their debut matches at Masters Shanghai. The Masters Madrid finalists got their first win of the Swiss stage, while Team Heretics finally got their first international series win of 2024. Leviatán looked strong on their map pick, but Gen.G rallied back to win the next two maps convincingly. As for Team Heretics, they looked just as strong as they were regionally , defeating a DRG roster making their international debut. Gen.G lose map one, roll over Leviatán next two The map veto began with Leviatán picking Icebox and Gen.G picking Lotus, leaving Breeze as the potential third map. Both teams began the series running Viper, Killjoy, and Jett, but the difference came with Gen.G opting for Gekko and KAY/O while Leviatán ran Sova and Harbor. This meant it was double smokes versus double initiator for this Icebox match. Leviatán started on attack and got the first pistol off mid-round patience. Erick \" aspas \" Santos started hot, getting a 4K in round five to extend the early lead for Leviatán. Round six was a flawless thrifty for Gen.G, with a large coordination of utility stopping a plant on B site. The four different grenades that Gen.G had allowed for some aggressive flood retakes and easy kills, but the team was also not able to gain as much information as Leviatán could mid-round. The half ended 7-5 in favor of Leviatán, however, Gen.G recovered the half after going down 5-1. Aspas gets a 4K on Icebox attack with his Jett ultimate. Leviatán won the second pistol, putting them in a prime position to take the map. Gen.G were able to hit some shots, but the defense from Leviatán was too strong, melting any attempted attack on A site. Both Ian \" tex \" Botsch and aspas cleaned the map up, ending it at 13-7 to start the series up 1-0. Lotus had both teams running mirror comps and Leviatán winning their third straight pistol round of the series. Gen.G looked better on their defense to start Lotus in comparison to Icebox, but Leviatán got their round wins by going to the C site. When aspas made one mistake with his ultimate, Gen.G took advantage to end the half up 7-5. Gen.G were able to get their first pistol win of the series thanks to the unstoppable force of Kim \" t3xture \" Na-ra (김나라) and Kim \" Karon \" Won-tae (김원태) . A 4K from t3xture put them up 11-5 and Gen.G closed it out with a perfect attack half to finish the map 13-5, tying the series. Breeze was the return of Yoru and Astra for the Gen.G side, with t3xture back on the Jett duel against aspas. Leviatán were relying on Cypher to help slow down the attack side from Gen.G, and tex was crucial in their fourth pistol win in five attempts. Gen.G used their double duelists, especially their Yoru, to confuse and surprise Leviatán with some set plays. Astra was key in setting up stuns, while Yoru would try and capitalize with teleports or flashes. The more chaotic the round got, the better Gen.G were. Plus, their post-plant setup for B site was very well-practiced, with Sova and Viper lineups to prevent any defuse from happening. Meteor and Gen.G clean up an attack round against Leviatán. Aspas was winning the Jett duel to help keep the half close, but the coordination from Gen.G was significant on their attack side. Down 8-4, Leviatán lost the second pistol round of the map. Kim \" Meteor \" Tae-oh (김태오) on Yoru was preventing Leviatán from taking open sites, teleporting in to support or playing aggressively alongside t3xture. The map ended 13-7, and Gen.G took the series 2-1. With this win, Gen.G have earned their first win of the Swiss stage, while Leviatán will start the tournament with a loss. Team Heretics sweep Dragon Ranger Gaming The second match of the day was between the only EMEA returnee from Masters Madrid and the third seed from China. Team Heretics enter Masters Shanghai with Patryk \" paTiTek \" Fabrowski substituting in for Dominykas \" MiniBoo \" Lukaševičius , while DRG make their international debut. The map veto started with DRG picking Icebox and Team Heretics picking Sunset, leaving Split as the potential third map. Icebox had the teams running slightly different comps, with double initiator from Heretics and double smokes from DRG. The series began with DRG on attack and Team Heretics getting the first pistol round. Due to the roster change for Shanghai, Mert \" Wo0t \" Alkan swapped onto the Jett, putting paTiTek back on the initiator role. It looked to be the right choice as Heretics converted their bonus round, getting an early lead on defense. A hero moment from Ilya \" vo0kashu \" Ushakov almost swung the momentum in favor of DRG, yet every time DRG looked to engage on A site afterward, Wo0t just denied them with his Jett. Heretics ended up 8-4 at the half. Wo0t lands nice Operator shots, then vo0kashu clutches an early round on Icebox. After winning the second pistol round of Icebox, Heretics ran away with the map. DRG were not able to get past the defensive setups of Benjamin \" benjyfishy \" David Fish and paTiTeK, leading to a 13-5 Heretics victory. For Sunset, Team Heretics chose to go Raze instead of Neon due to their roster change. Heretics won a close pistol round and converted another bonus round. DRG needed to turn the momentum around, as another hero moment from DRG got them their first round. This time, it was Tang \" nizhaoTZH \" Zehao (唐哲昊) with a 3K, and soon after Shao \" Nicc \" Yi-qun (邵逸群) hit key shots to keep the half close. DRG adapted better to Team Heretics than they did on Icebox, trying to re-clear specific areas on the map with mixed success. The half ended 7-5 for Heretics, with DRG in reach of a map win. However, a fourth straight pistol win and another bonus round conversion from Heretics pushed a comeback further out of reach. Wo0t was one-tapping DRG into dust, getting 27 kills on Sunset alone, totaling 41 across the series. Team Heretics closed the map out 13-5 with a perfect second half, sweeping DRG to start their Swiss stage run. With this win, Team Heretics start 1-0 in the Swiss stage, while DRG will start down 0-1."

    "cleaned_content": "When the draft came for the Swiss stage of Masters Shanghai, the second seed from Americas, G2 Esports , drew the third seed from Pacific, T1 . This matchup has few connections on the outside, but for at least one player, it means a lot. G2 versus T1 marks the first battle between old teammates. The core from G2 Esports, consisting of Jacob \" valyn \" Batio , Jonah \" JonahP \" Pulice , and Trent \" trent \" Cairns , used to play alongside T1 duelist Ha \" Sayaplayer \" Jeong-woo (하정우) . They shared some amazing moments, and now they will face off against each other to start Shanghai. Sayaplayer came into the Valorant scene on T1 but truly exploded into a star duelist on North American team The Guard . Alongside valyn, JonahP, trent, and former G2 player Michael \" neT \" Bernet , they climbed from open qualification tournaments to the top of their region . When they went to Masters Reykjavík in early 2022 , it looked like the region had another contender. Then The Guard lost to tough opposition, struggled regionally, and could not secure a slot in franchising. Sayaplayer after joining T1 in 2023. (Image via Sayaplayer) That marked the first change in the core, with Sayaplayer rejoining T1 for their franchised roster. The rest of The Guard roster stuck together, added Ian \" tex \" Botsch , and won Ascension , earning their chance to compete in tier one. Alas, with The Guard ceasing operations soon after, G2 Esports picked the roster up. The team did make more roster changes since then, but G2 have kept the same core and coach that won them Ascension in 2023. Even from an entirely different region and time zone, Sayaplayer harbors no ill will towards his former teammates and still follows how they do in their respective competitions. “I keep in touch with them once in a while through messaging, hearing the major updates through announcements,” Sayaplyer said. “I know what they've been doing, and it is great for them to make it back to an international tournament again.” Like many others who kept their eyes on the draft for the starting games at Masters Shanghai, the reaction he had to the matchup was one of excitement, both to show how he has grown since previous events and to face off against some familiar foes. \"It was welcoming news for me,\" Sayaplayer said, \"and it will be interesting to see what kind of unique plays they will use when they face off against us. Both G2 and T1 have outstanding players, but when we have momentum, we know we can focus. We both played okay in the regular season, but when we got into playoffs, we were able to show what we could do.\" Heading into their respective regional playoffs in Stage 1, neither G2 nor T1 had a great record. G2 got into the Stage 1 playoffs via map differential at 3-3, while T1 made their playoffs with a losing 2-4 record. Alas, both teams upset other rosters that performed better than them in the regular season. G2 had to beat both Cloud9 and KRÜ Esports , while T1 had to beat Team Secret and Masters Madrid finalists Gen.G . Sayaplayer and T1 rematch against Gen.G in the VCT Pacific 2024 Stage 1 playoffs. (Image via Riot Games) While Sayaplayer remains dedicated to his first Valorant team, now alongside a new core that he plays as the star duelist, he did say that he would enjoy the idea of going back and reliving those old days on The Guard. “I know they're great players and I've seen how they've grown across the year,” Sayaplayer said. “Maybe in the future, I'd love to play with them again.” These two rosters both grew across the year, going from missing out on Madrid to going to Shanghai. Their trajectories led the teams to each other, alongside plenty of other hungry teams competing to be the best. Sayaplayer knows FNATIC and EDward Gaming are two teams he would love to match up against with his squad, but he knows he has to focus on the first team in the schedule and cut any emotional ties when the barriers drop. T1 will face off against G2 Esports to start Masters Shanghai ."

    "cleaned_content": "In just one tournament, DRX went from perennial Pacific powerhouse to dark horse. One reason for this was due to the team changing its roster to incorporate promising prospects into its lineup. But the team's newest addition, Cho \" Flashback \" Min-hyuk (조민혁) , had to leave the starting lineup soon after Kickoff ended. That's when DRX brought in another prospect, Kang \" BeYN \" Ha-bin (강하빈) , to replace him. As it turned out, BeYN led them to an undefeated regular season and stood out as the player who brought the mood up in a team that needed some change. Looking back, BeYN entered the team at the one moment in the past couple of years that DRX had less pressure on their shoulders. After winning tournament after tournament in Korea, they entered Pacific as a perennial contender. Then, after a disappointing end to 2023, they released both Kim \" Zest \" Ki-seok (김기석) and Goo \" Rb \" Sang-min (구상민) to put their prospects Jung \" Foxy9 \" Jae-sung (정재성) and Flashback on the roster. Pacific Kickoff was good, though still showing areas they needed to improve on. Then, Flashback announced that he had to step down to the inactive roster due to personal reasons , and BeYn got brought up. Heading into the Stage 1 regular season, BeYN himself had worried that he would have to fill in big shoes. Not only were Zest and Rb gone, but he also saw Flashback as a great player he had to replace in his own way. “Our teammates Zest and RB, I know how good and dominant they were,” BeYN said. “I was hesitant or worried to replace them, and I knew I could get the opportunity but also knew Flashback was better than me at the time. I didn't think I had a spot, so I just worked on myself and eventually got that chance at the big leagues.” BeYN celebrates alongside his teammates on the VCT Pacific stage. (Image via DRX) From his time involved in the DRX system, he got to know both the main roster and the prospects, and in turn they knew of him. Even then, the overall vibe around the team heading into Stage 1 was a small sense of panic, until BeYN and the team got their first win under their belt. “When Stage 1 began and Flashback had to go, the team had the mentality that we were in trouble,” BeYN said. “Our first game was against Team Secret , and we still had that mentality, but as the match went on I felt like I was playing in Challengers again. I pushed our team to do all the basics right, and when we played together, I got that confidence to play well for the team.” Team Secret were their first win, but their match against Gen.G was the true test against top opposition. Not only were Gen.G finalists at Masters Madrid, but they started well in the regular season, only losing to Paper Rex . Out of all the star players in the lobby between DRX and Gen.G, it was BeYN who led the lobby in almost all stats. Match rating, ACS, kills, KAST, you name it and BeYN was the best on it , all while playing the usually quiet controller role. BeYN gets a 4K to win Bind against Gen.G Not only was BeYN crucial to their wins, he was keeping the mood light and fun despite the pressure he put on himself to do well. In fact, the rumor grew that there was a nickname that BeYN had regionally: Korean Zellsis. Talking to BeYN, this name did not come out of the blue. In fact, he might have come up with it himself out of admiration of the Sentinels player. “The nickname Korean Zellsis, there isn't any one good origin story,” BeYN said. “When I looked at Jordan \" Zellsis \" Montemurro , I just saw someone that loved the gym and that was something I wanted to share with him, from my perspective. I also know he brings up the energy for the team and the fans, and that's something I want to do. But I do scream that I am Korean Zellsis in scrims, so I wanted to keep that energy into VCT, and I guess it came through in comms.” Whether it was in the gym or in the server, the nickname stuck around long enough for it to appear on popular podcast Plat Chat Valorant . From there, BeYN only grew in popularity and in game, keeping up the form from the Gen.G game to compete the regular season undefeated. DRX were in the easier group in retrospect, but DRX faced their own troubles that they overcame. As the self-appointed \"moodmaker\" for the squad, BeYN fit into the roster easily. “In my opinion, I think I have a unique personality to bring the mood up even if things are looking bad,” BeYN said. “I've been with the org for a while, and I was familiar with the roster anyway. When I joined the team, they just accepted me for who I was, so it all worked out.” DRX huddle before a match in VCT Pacific. (Image via DRX) It worked out until the playoffs. DRX got a hard draw, first facing off against regional and international contenders Paper Rex. The series went to three maps , but Paper Rex just squeezed through to get their spot in Shanghai. Thanks to DRX going undefeated, they got another chance in the lower bracket, but T1 upset Gen.G to set up another matchup against a team that made it to Madrid. Alas, Gen.G were adamant to rebound after that upset, as DRX lost another three-map series . Those two losses were brutal for the momentum DRX built, reminiscent of how good T1 was to start the season before losing to Paper Rex to miss out on Masters Madrid. As any good player does in tough moments, the losses taught BeYN some crucial lessons about himself. “In the playoffs, facing Paper Rex in the first set, I just was too nervous,” BeYN said. “I think I still need to learn to control that, and improve on my fear of playing on a big stage. Facing against Gen.G, we lost a big lead on Sunset. All of us relaxed a little too early when we were up 7-0, and until we finish out a map, we can't relax or underestimate anyone.” Now, watching Masters Shanghai from home, BeYN will continue with DRX to try and redeem their playoff performance in Stage 2 and potentially qualify for Champions. If he can keep up his form from the Stage 1 regular season, DRX will be on a good trajectory to make it back to Champions and compete for an international title once again. And this time around, if they make it, they'll have a type of player they've always needed: a hype man who can back it up."

    "cleaned_content": "Natus Vincere have moved former head coach Erik \" d00mbr0s \" Sandgren, also known as d00mbr0s, to the inactive roster. Going forward, Oliwer \" LATEKS \" Fahlander will take on the head coach role. The move marks the end of a year-and-a-half relationship between Erik and NAVI. During this time, he led the team to multiple top-four finishes, including LOCK//IN in 2023 and EMEA Kickoff in 2024. Erik's career as a coach began in 2020 during the closed beta. In April of that year, he formed the orgless team, FABRIKEN , alongside LATEKS and Shadow, who currently plays for KOI. Zyppan joined the team in June, and they made consistent grand finals appearances throughout the year. The FABRIKEN core was picked up by FunPlus Phoenix , where they joined ANGE1 and Shao to form one of the region's first “super teams”. Erik joined as trial coach, but later became an analyst for the team. Once again, they consistently made tournament finals, but were unable to make it past the top four in First Strike and Masters 1, Europe's first official Riot events. After Masters 1 and failing to make Masters Reykjavík, Erik was promoted to head coach. FPX once again did not qualify to Masters Berlin, and various roster moves across different orgs meant they were five points shy of qualifying to the 2021 LCQ. Ahead of the 2022 season, the team welcomed two new players, ardiis and SUYGETSU . The new roster went out in the group stage of Red Bull Home Ground, but had their sights set on VCT 2022. The new focus paid off, as they won Challengers 1 with only a single loss despite needing an emergency substitute due to the escalation in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. The victory qualified them to their first-ever international tournament, but the team was unable to attend Masters Reykjavík due to travel restrictions. Success continued for FPX, propelled by the new roster's synergy and the Erik-ANGE1 constant innovation. Once again, they reached the Challengers 2 grand final, qualifying to Masters Copenhagen. The org was able to secure travel for their full roster, but SUYGETSU would join after the group stage, should they advance to playoffs. FunPlus Phoenix went on to play every single match possible in the event, defeating the Masters Reykjavík winners 3-1 and winning the grand final 3-2 against Paper Rex. FunPlus Phoenix finished in the top four in Champions 2022. After the end of the season, the org did not make the EMEA partner league, and the majority of the roster, including Erik, joined NAVI . LATEKS will be taking Erik's place as head coach for the remainder of the season. He has worked with NAVI as assistant coach and analyst since the FPX core joined the org in 2022. His career as coach is less extensive than Erik's, first taking up the role in 2022 for Spanish org Giants Gaming . He helped the team reach top four in both VRL Spain splits that year, and he was picked up by NAVI soon after. Natus Vincere will next play against Team Heretics in Stage 2 of VCT EMEA: Kyrylo \" ANGE1 \" Karasov Andrey \" Shao \" Kiprsky Pontus \" Zyppan \" Eek Dmitry \" SUYGETSU \" Ilyushin Ardis \" ardiis \" Svarenieks Oliwer \" LATEKS \" Fahlander (Head coach)"

    "title": "A year on: what's the AVPA been up to?",

    "url": "https://www.vlr.gg/344211/a-year-on-whats-the-avpa-been-up-to",
    "cleaned_content": "“Ninety-five percent of the work that we do is done behind closed doors. Some of our biggest accomplishments were stuff that we can't talk about, unfortunately. I can talk a little about it, I just can't give specifics.” That was one of the first things Taylor \" tailored \" Broomall said about his position as the Americas Valorant Players Association 's (AVPA) program manager. A large part of the job is held under secrecy due to the many intricacies and moving parts the AVPA is involved with. And that sentence set the tone for the entire conversation. Every case the AVPA handled publicly — NSG's 2023 debts , The Guard 's fiasco , XSET 's ongoing debts to its players, Evil Geniuses ' contract jail , and some others — has many caveats that can't be fully explained because they involve privileged information, unsolved issues, and a general need to maintain a working relationship with Riot, the organizations, and the players. Most of those cases suffered from miscommunication, Tailored argued. As an example, last year, despite being recently released, the AVPA confirmed alongside Riot that Deadlock was slated to be used in the 2023 LCQ and Game Changers II in North America. Riot reversed that decision several hours later without consulting the AVPA, leading to a confusing back-and-forth between what was public and private information. “It goes to show that even at these large tech companies, miscommunication is the killer of every org, every team, every company. And one of the pieces of advocacy we try to maintain is the most transparent and smoothest line of communication we can.” But Deadlock was just a symptom of a larger miscommunication problem. The association saw the same issues with The Guard and Evil Geniuses. Riot made a decision about The Guard without discussing it with the players and, to Tailored, EG and Peak6 were making decisions without communicating “with each other in a healthy way.” The mismanagement of Deadlock's debut was the first of many problems the AVPA followed last year. (Image via Riot Games) During the time companies were blowing their esports portfolios up, the AVPA was there at every step of the way alongside the players, managers, and coaches, to make sure solutions were found and that everyone was made whole. Last year, the AVPA helped recover over half a million dollars in missing prize money or revenue share. Most of that came from working alongside Riot to settle outstanding debts from, for example, Nerd Street Gamers , who had complications arise after third-party financing issues. “Props to them for trying to make it right, but it was too slow,” Tailored said. “It's unfortunate, because I think the staff at NSG did a great job with their events. But these people are working for a living, they have to get paid. Riot took a while, but they helped us find a solution that would make the players whole again.” Riot and the AVPA made sure NSG did good on its debts. (Photo by NSG) In more complicated cases like The Guard's, the AVPA's role was that of identifying the key problems and working alongside all the involved parties to fix them. While the community was busy frothing over the drama surrounding The Guard, Tailored sat in meetings. He went back-and-forth with Riot, EG, and the players in dozens of phone calls that ultimately gave the AVPA and everyone what they wanted: let the players find another organization to participate in the VCT. Tailored spoke on the complexity of the situation, with a reminder that “these TPA [Team Participation Agreements] are business partnerships.” “Not only do they need to vet the public side of the org on how good they are, they need to vet their finances, their staff, etc. It's a big process and Riot's legal department is very much in control of that aspect. The final decision comes down to the esports team and [competitive operations], but legal has a big say in what goes on.” The AVPA program manager also said that he doesn't blame Riot for the time they took to finalize the deal, as “there's 100 different people at Riot that need to look at the info, sign off on it and all communicate with each other.” And while he does, conversely, blame Riot for the lack of communication throughout this process, Tailored also looks at the bright side of things and how they are now kept apprised of new information with much more intent than before, as “situations like this are actually where [they] can gain a lot of favor in building those communication pipelines.” They were this close to not making the VCT. But the AVPA helped save them. (Photo by Bruno Alvares/Riot Brazil) In regards to more recent situations like XSET's and EG's, Tailored was even more tight-lipped than in the other cases discussed. Nothing could really be said about XSET as there is an ongoing legal battle, and “the court system is really slow in the US.” XSET does, however, still owe the players this money and their case is solid, he defends, meaning an update should come in the near future. “Not to be crass, but XSET sucks. They fucked these players over,” Tailored said. “It's not some savvy business move. This was stupid business. The way they tried to get out of paying... it wasn't even creative.” Some more could be said about EG blowing up their championship-winning roster. During that time and in short, the AVPA's job was to be a \"patient advocate\" for the players and, alongside Riot, outlasting EG's patience in locking the players down. “We feel that Riot probably could have taken more immediate steps to handle it, but they would have been extreme,” Tailored said. While he didn't reveal which solutions were ever on the table, the program manager said that, personally, he “would have slept perfectly okay at night” if EG were removed from the partnership altogether. “I don't blame Riot for taking their time and being more patient with it, because, again, EG is a business partner. Peak6 is a business partner to Riot, they can't just go out and expect no legal retribution,” he said. “They need to be careful with this stuff. I totally understand where Riot's coming from. Riot was empathetic with the players and they tried to help work on the solution to get it solved.” Only jawgemo and potter remain after last year's issues. (Photo by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games) While most of the front-page drama happens in the VCT, the AVPA operates on all levels of the competitive Valorant ecosystem. Their success in making sure NSG did good on their 2023 debts was one of the ways the AVPA showed it looks out for more than the top 10 teams in the world. Another way they do so is fighting for a better calendar and competitive system in the lower leagues. In an attempt to fix last year's general consensus that the 2023 schedule was cramped and the offseason long — there was no real competition between September 2023 and February 2024 — Riot offered some changes to tier 2. Not much changed for tier 1, it was still the same schedule, but tier 2 would now play Ascension in September (as opposed to June/July). A third Challengers Split was also added to the final three months of the year. It will serve as the kickoff to the 2025 season, whose calendar is yet to be revealed. Two weeks after that, the AVPA held an AMA where Tailored said he expected 2024 to be a much better year for the VCT in that regard. Eight months on? “No, I wouldn't say that it feels any better this year than it did last year,” he said. Tailored tried to justify Riot's scheduling issues by framing them as an infrastructure problem: the League of Legends World Championship takes place in the fall, meaning Champions must be held before that as the same team runs both events. Once Champions is scheduled for August, everything must take place before it, effectively forcing Riot to run the VCT in the span of eight months. The third Challengers split was one of Riot's band-aid fixes to tier 2, the association believes, as the latter hold that “investing, even over-investing in tier 2, is never going to hurt you in the long run. Especially if you can afford it as a AAA developer.” Their belief is sustained by the history of fighting games and Counter-Strike, where there are next to no barriers between tiers of competition. Tailored argues that the long-lasting health and success of the fighting game and CS communities boils down to these grassroots systems. For the VCT to thrive from the top down, the AVPA argues the calendar should be stretched out. Maybe Riot can hold Champions and Worlds sometime later in the year to avoid stacking the calendar. Maybe they can alternate play between Valorant and League of Legends. That would allow Riot to fix many of the underlying issues instead of a band-aid third split, which Tailored said may actually be detrimental. “It's nice to see them get more play, but it's just going to add complications for players trying to find teams after Champions has ended. I don't know where that idea came from.” Tier 2 doesn't need a third split, it needs a smaller offseason. (Photo by Hara Amorós/Riot Games) In the midst of worrying about players, the AVPA has to make sure it stays afloat. This year, the association was concerned about making headway on two fronts. First, the agent certification program. This program will allow the AVPA to run a background check on and certify agents to create more protection for players. As a part of this program, the AVPA reached an agreement with Riot that will force organizations to provide in their contracts a list of certified lawyers and agents, which will also be public, that players should reach out to before signing. Second, the group rights program. Group licensing deals are how PAs are traditionally funded. Players sign these agreements and give “very limited name, image, and likeness rights to the PA to sell in collective categories.” This will allow the PA to sell things like trading cards, bobbleheads, Funko POPs, posters, Fatheads, and other assorted merchandise. That revenue is then divided up between the AVPA's internal programs, and the remaining share is handed out evenly to players as a bonus. Merchandise is the future of the AVPA's financing. (Photo by Mary Watson/Riot Games) In major PAs, like the NBA's NBPA, group licensing can represent nearly $100 million in revenue to be handed out to players. As part of their groups rights program, Tailored revealed that the AVPA already has a deal set in stone with a major trading card company in the USA that will print cards from 2025 beyond in a multi-year deal that will see them get money upfront and sales revenue. “We're getting the VCT players signed on first, and then the Challengers players are coming through with a very similar deal, and Game Changers after that. This is going on in League of Legends too,” Tailored said. Following other player associations' models, pivoting to trading cards and enabling themselves to sell other merchandise is how the AVPA plans to keep themselves afloat for the next few years. It's how they'll keep standing by players, fighting for their rights, and making sure the competitive ecosystem in the Americas is fair for all those involved as they have done so far. And even without group licensing, they're already seeing an upturn. The future looks good for the AVPA and its mission. “We do have a positive cash flow,” Tailored said. “We will be profitable next year and we'll be able to give some amount of funds to each player under the pie. And that includes Game Changers, Challengers and VCT.”"

Blinn surprised many as they were promoted into Challengers, while Dough Bros managed to scrape by Thinking Men and Resonate to retain their slot in the league. Now, the twelve Challengers teams are set to resume their quest towards Ascension by battling for circuit points in the Mid Season Cup. However, many rosters have opted to undergo changes ahead of the second Stage of competition. The four highest seeds consisting of Moist x Shopify , Oxygen Esports , M80 , and Turtle Troop have all retained their rosters and used the break to practice and prepare for their matches. Out of the four, only MxS remain undefeated, finishing the regular season with a 5-0 record and securing a first seed heading into the Mid Season Cup. QoR , TSM , and SaD Esports have also kept their rosters from Stage 1. All three organizations secured at least two wins in the regular season and look to make deep runs in hopes of netting vast amounts of circuit points. The remaining teams from last Stage have all undergone changes and swapped out players. The former Together We Are Terrific core of Paincakes , mummAy , and neptune were joined by YFP 's Jonaaa6 and bones on a rebranded FLUFFY AIMERS . Former Cloud9 veteran shinobi has joined as a coach to assist with improving the squad. In a surprising turn of events, YFP picked up Will and jakee , another Cloud9 alumni who until recently announced his retirement from competitive gaming. Will most notably competed with 100 Thieves in 2022, representing North America on the international stage. Finally, Winthrop University have picked up former world champion ScrewFace to lead the team through Challengers. The talent had bounced between Tier 2 teams prior to the commencement of Stage 1, but was unable to settle on any before joining Winthrop. Collegiate champion Ali joins from Northwood University to round out the roster. Only the top four teams of the Mid Season Cup will receive circuit points. The other eight must wait for Stage 2 and perform well above their standards to have a chance at making it to Ascension. The round of 12 will commence today at 4 EST, and will conclude with the early exit of four teams.

    "cleaned_content": "FNATIC have defeated Team Heretics 3-2 in the VCT EMEA 2024 Stage 1 grand finals , earning the top seed for EMEA at Masters Shanghai. With this loss, Team Heretics has lost both regional grand finals coming out of the winners bracket, after losing to Karmine Corp at the EMEA Kickoff earlier this year . The map veto started with Team Heretics picking Sunset and Fnatic picking Bind. Heretics then picked Lotus and Fnatic picked Split, leaving Breeze as the potential final map. Sunset remained a great map for Heretics To start the series off, Dominykas \" MiniBoo \" Lukaševičius was on one of his best agents: Neon. On the Fnatic side, Emir \" Alfajer \" Ali Beder made the rare Deadlock pick alongside the Yoru pick from Nikita \" Derke \" Sirmitev . Starting with a pistol round win, Team Heretics used the anchor capabilities of Benjamin \" benjyfishy \" David Fish on Cypher and the aggression of MiniBoo to set up some smart strategies on defense. An 8-4 lead at the half, another pistol win for Team Heretics, and the map was effectively theirs. Fnatic only managed to get three rounds on their defense, as Team Heretics won map one 13-7. Bind was the only overtime map of the series Bind began with different compositions from the two teams, with Heretics opting for the Yoru, Sova, and Omen while Fnatic went with Brimstone, Raze, and Gekko. After winning the first pistol round, Fnatic lost three rounds in a row after not being able to plant the spike. That was thanks to patience and good rotations from Team Heretics. It continued to cause issues on their attack, but the pistol round win and good awareness of their economy got them enough rounds to tie things up at the half 6-6. Team Heretics won the second half pistol round, and converted their bonus thanks to successful duels from everyone on the team. That led to an 11-6 lead, but Fnatic held strong on their defense. Retakes were the name of the game, with Alfajer getting the most impact on the Viper. Fnatic recovered from the 11-6 deficit to take it to overtime. benjyfishy closes out Bind with three kills in overtime. Alas, after getting the first overtime round win, it was all Heretics. The defining moment was benjyfishy getting his ultimate down and a triple kill on the final round, securing the map. Team Heretics won 15-13, going up 2-0 in the series. Lotus had the biggest one-map swing of the series For team compositions, Team Heretics ran their Lotus default comp with a Breach and a Cypher, while Fnatic ran their default comp with Killjoy, Omen, Viper, and Raze. Team Heretics won the first pistol round, and then converted their bonus to go up 4-0. Fnatic fought back to win two rounds, but Heretics swung it back to go up 7-2 off of a rare benjyfishy Operator pickup as the attack Cypher. Fnatic were down 2-0 in the series, and 7-2 down in the map. It looked like the end of the line for the former international champions, but they slowly fought back in the map to keep themselves alive in a potential reverse sweep. After winning the final three rounds of their defense, Fnatic won the second pistol round and converted their bonus round. That economic advantage proved too much for Heretics to overcome, only winning one round on their defense side. The map ended 13-8 for Fnatic, getting them their first map win of the series. Split shows how good Fnatic and their duelists can be Where all the maps previously were either close or one-sided for Heretics, Split ended up one-sided for Fnatic. With Derke back on Yoru and Alfajer on Raze, Heretics had a lot of pressure to shut down Fnatic and their momentum in the series with a strong defense. Fnatic won the first pistol round, with Alfajer starting hot and never truly slowing down. For a player that has played a lot of sentinel recently, his Raze had no signs of rust. In the first half alone, he had 17 kills and four first kills against Heretics, who only had two across their entire team on their defense. Heretics were able to keep the game close, only down 7-5 at the half. Fnatic won the second half pistol round, converted their bonus, and showed their experience on Split by not losing a single round. Alfajer was unstoppable in the first half, but Derke went 11/0/3 on defense to complete their perfect second half. The map ended 13-5 for Fnatic, taking the series to map five. Breeze decided it all for EMEA Stage 1 For the final map of the grand finals, Fnatic and Heretics ran the mirror composition of Yoru, KAY/O, Viper, and Cypher. Fnatic won the first pistol round thanks to a Boaster 4K on the flank. They even had a good bonus round despite losing it, keeping Heretics with a bad economy as the Fnatic players just grew in confidence. Leo \" Leo \" Jannesson was the star on defense, getting as much value with his utility as he did with his gun. While the round score was not impossible to come back from, the rounds were as one-sided as could be, with Fnatic up 8-4 heading into the half. Leo uses great utility to secure a 3K on Breeze. Leo was battling illness all throughout this series, with the team revealing after the game that he was struggling to communicate with his team. That only made his plays as Sova more impressive, entirely relying on his knowledge of the game or calls from his teammates for his utility. Fnatic won the second half pistol round, but Heretics got a crucial eco win to ease the blow of losing pistol round. Heretics were getting their confidence back in the match, notably MiniBoo and Mert \" Wo0t \" Alkan improving considerably on their defense. Then a round where Fnatic hit B site with a minute to go led to some questionable ultimates from Heretics, and that potential comeback was shut down. Fnatic closed out the map 13-8, and completed the rare best-of-five reverse sweep to win the EMEA Stage 1 playoffs. Leo, with his illness, could not lift the trophy, but he was the MVP of the series all the same. With this win, Fnatic are the number one seed from EMEA for Masters Shanghai, earning a bye to the playoff stage of the tournament. As for Team Heretics, finishing second place for the second time this year earns them the second seed for EMEA at Masters Shanghai. They will need to play through the Swiss stage for their chance at the Shanghai title."

    "cleaned_content": "Paper Rex defeated Gen.G 3-2 in the VCT Pacific 2024 Stage 1 grand finals, securing their first regional title since winning the Pacific league in 2023 . This rematch of the Pacific Kickoff finals went the distance, with Paper Rex getting revenge on the team that beat them last time. With this win, Paper Rex secured extra circuit points for Champions, alongside the regional first seed, and a bye to the playoff stage of Masters Shanghai. Gen.G finished in second place, securing the second seed for Pacific. The map picks began with Paper Rex picking Lotus first, then Gen.G picking Sunset. PRX then picked Icebox, and Gen.G picked Bind, leaving Split as the potential final map. Gen.G remain top-tier on Lotus For Lotus, Paper Rex ran a double duelist composition while Gen.G ran the double controller. With how strong Paper Rex looked on Lotus during the playoffs, which have included a 13-0 over TALON , the beginning looked like the map could spiral into another huge lead for PRX. Winning the pistol round on attack and converting their bonus, it took a 4v5 retake win from Gen.G to get their first round. With that important round win, Gen.G brought the half back by winning six of the remaining eight rounds in the first half. It was the Kim \" t3xture \" Na-ra (김나라) show to start Lotus, as he walked into the 6-6 half with 16 kills and 100% KAST. When Gen.G won the second pistol round of the map, they went on their own run similar to how Paper Rex started Lotus, but better. After winning the first five rounds of their attack side, Paper Rex would need a big comeback to win the map. Despite some strong aggressive defense rounds from PRX, Gen.G closed the map out 13-9 thanks to t3xture dropping 28 kills. Sunset was a one-man show for Paper Rex Sunset was a battle between two very different compositions. Paper Rex ran Raze, Gekko, Breach, and Sage, while Gen.G ran Jett, KAY/O, Cypher, and Sova. The only agent that both teams used was Omen. Gen.G won the first pistol round, but as soon as Paper Rex got rifles in their hands, they put all their faith in their star Raze player. Wang \" Jinggg \" Jing Jie had himself a map, getting 12 kills and only dying five times on their attack. Jinggg gets a 4K on defense. The Jett wasn't working well on the attack side for Gen.G, with Paper Rex putting a lot of their focus on t3xture after his performance on Lotus. The lead heading into the half was 7-5 for PRX, a good attack side considering they lost the pistol round. Paper Rex lost their second pistol round of the map, but the rifle rounds were just too clean. Jinggg got more first kills in the second half than he did in the first, ending the map with a 7-1 first-kill/first-death ratio. Just like map one, the score was 13-9, but with Paper Rex tying the series 1-1. Icebox was a battle between the best Jett players in VCT Pacific The first two maps of the series were seemingly close at the half until one team ran away with it. Icebox was the first chess match, with the two teams trading rounds evenly throughout. The compositions were relatively similar, with the key difference being Gekko on Paper Rex and Sage from Gen.G. Paper Rex won the pistol round to start, attacking well against the double sentinel comp from Gen.G. As usual, t3xture proved to be a problem for PRX as he had 17 kills heading into the half. However, nobody else on Gen.G had more than eight. The Jett of Ilya \" something \" Petrov was key, keeping the Jett duel close with 15 kills, 249 ADR, and three first kills. It was another 7-5 lead at the half for PRX. Gen.G got the second pistol round but fought better on the rifle rounds to keep the map within reach. Despite not getting as many frags as his counterpart, something continued to win the first kill race with five in the second half, three more than t3xture. The map was tied four different times in the second half, with the final one as late as 11-11. In the end, when it mattered most, something used a Guardian to get two crucial kills to put PRX on match point. Then, with his ultimate in the next round, something got the first kill for the second round in a row followed by a clutch triple kill by Khalish \" d4v41 \" Rusyaidee to close out the map 13-11. Munchkin steps up on Bind to take it to map five For the two teams, Paper Rex decided to run no sentinel on Bind, instead opting for the double initiator and Harbor over Viper. Gen.G ran something more akin to a standard Bind comp, with Cypher, Viper, and t3xture back on Raze. Paper Rex won the first pistol round on their attack, using that momentum to get up 6-2. Both Jinggg and Jason \" f0rsakeN \" Susanto did well, but Byeon \" Munchkin \" Sang-beom (변상범) and Kim \" Lakia \" Jong-min (김종민) fought back to pull the match to 6-6 at the half. Gen.G adapted well to the potential Raze plays from Jinggg, using the Judge often on A site to make the close corners hard to clear out without using abilities. Gen.G took the second half pistol round, and despite the rifle rounds starting to go to PRX, Gen.G got two round wins off of a 2v3 win and opening pick. Munchkin kickstarted both those round wins, and the economy crashed for Paper Rex. Gen.G closed out the map 13-9, taking the series to the winner-takes-all map five. Paper Rex wins Split and series off of rock-solid defense Split was the first and only mirror match of the series, with both teams running double duelist. Gen.G won the first pistol on Split, using the Jett from Kim \" Meteor \" Tae-oh (김태오) and Kim \" Karon \" Won-tae (김원태) on Omen to make entries onto B site tough. Meteor gets a Marshal 4K on Split defense. Even when Paper Rex got the spike down, Gen.G had the protocol to retake the site. Instead of going for a flood retake or some well-placed utility, they expected Paper Rex to hold aggressively and ended up punishing them accordingly. The focus from Gen.G was to target Jinggg, who went 5/10/3 on his attack side and put all the pressure on something to carry. That strategy worked to slow down Paper Rex, but something did step up to keep the map within reach. Gen.G entered the half up 7-5. Paper Rex won the final pistol round of the series, arguably the most important pistol of the finals. Then, they converted their bonus round thanks to an Outlaw 3K from something and a critical pop flash 2K from f0rsakeN. Paper Rex win a crucial bonus round on Split. Gen.G lost any economic advantage, and Paper Rex capitalized on it. Gen.G forced Stingers the round afterward, and Aaron \" mindfreak \" Leonhart got a triple kill to end that hope of a comeback. Gen.G only won one round on their attack side as Paper Rex shut the door on the team that beat them in Kickoff and Masters Madrid. Paper Rex won the map 13-8 and the series 3-2. As the series concluded, it was fair for Jinggg to earn match MVP with how crucial he was in entry kills, ending the series with a 19-7 first kill/first death ratio. However, t3xture was statistically the best player in this best-of-five. The series ended with the star duelist on Gen.G having a VCT best-of-five record of 105 kills across all five maps. Paper Rex will enter Masters Shanghai as the number one seed from Pacific, earning a bye to the playoff stage and earning the choice of their opponent. Gen.G will enter Masters Shanghai in second place and will begin in the Swiss stage alongside the two and three seeds from all other regions."

    "cleaned_content": "EDward Gaming have once again established themselves on top of the Chinese scene with a 3-1 victory over their perennial domestic rivals FunPlus Phoenix . Despite having lost their two most recent matchups, EDG recovered with the entire squad stepping up alongside star player ZmjjKK . ZmjjKK has far and away looked like the MVP of the regular season after averaging the highest ACS and KPR in the league at 284 and 0.99 respectively. However, FPX's star duo of Life and Lysoar took the spots just behind, with Life taking the second-place spot on the ACS leaderboard and Lysoar leading the league in K/D. FPX came into the series via the upper bracket after taking their initial matchup versus EDG 2-0 and as a result, were granted two map bans coming into the best-of-five series. FPX take EDG's permaban in stride The series began with FPX picking EDG's permaban Lotus after opting to use their two bans on Split and Sunset. Split has proven to be EDG's best map in 2024 thus far with an 83% win rate including a 13-9 win over Paper Rex at Masters Madrid. EDG last played Lotus at the AfreecaTV VALORANT LEAGUE during the off-season where they recorded 13-3 and 13-6 losses to Team Liquid and T1 . In a move reminiscent of Redgar 's Reyna on Gambit Esports 's permaban of Haven, CHICHOO locked in Reyna for just the fifth time in his career. FPX got off to a strong start by winning the first pistol and bonus round to take a 4-0 lead before EDG could respond with two rounds of their own. However, Haodong 's troops found little leeway throughout the rest of the half as FPX's momentum propelled them to a 9-3 first half. Despite the one-sided scoreline ZmjjKK still got his highlights. An EDG pistol round in the second half provided a slight bit of relief before FPX continued their dominance in the gun rounds. FPX quickly closed out the map 13-6 off the back of a standout performance from Lysoar. The controller ended Lotus with a 20-12 K/D and 260 ACS. EDG dominate the second half of Bind to even up the series This time around EDG managed to pick up the bonus following another FPX pistol win to kick off a much more competitive half. A brief 4-1 lead for FPX was counteracted with a thrifty win for EDG in round six thanks to a 3K from ZmjjKK. Traded rounds followed as clutch moments went the way of both teams with a 1v1 from BerLIN and multikills from the trio of CHICHOO, ZmjjKK, and Smoggy . The pistol victory brought FPX a narrow lead coming into the second half at 7-5. Haodong cleans up the anti-eco. EDG slowed down the pace once moving onto the attack and carried the momentum from a pistol win throughout the half. EDG utilized ZmjjKK's attacking Operator to its fullest extent to find opening picks and boost EDG's ult economy which could then be converted into site executes. FPX won just a single gun round in the second half before EDG evened up the series at 1-1 with a 13-9 on Bind. ZmjjKK continued his run of good form with 260 ACS and a plethora of opening kills while Smoggy had the highest K/D in the server with a 21-14 stat line. On the other hand, FPX found a rare top-fragging game from BerLIN as the in-game leader dropped 20 kills of his own. EDG narrowly edge past FPX on Icebox An EDG pistol provided false hope for EDG fans coming into the third map as FPX's triple controller comp ran rampant throughout the early stages of the half. The midrounding from FPX was sublime as gaps in EDG's mid control allowed for frequent flanks and access to empty sites. The clutch moments were also going the way of FPX as Life recovered from an uncommonly poor second map with a 1v3 in the eighth round. Life stepped up with Clove on Icebox. EDG once again picked up the pistol thanks to a 1v1 clutch from ZmjjKK but desperately hoped to bring this success into the gun rounds. EDG hedged their bets correctly on winning the bonus after bringing out a third-round Operator, forcing FPX to take a timeout after closing the gap to just one round at 8-7. The timeout was followed by a 4K from nobody with a Bulldog to immediately nullify the timeout and even up the score. A 3K from Autumn ended EDG's dominant streak of six rounds and kept the series close. FPX managed to tighten their hold on middle, despite their lack of a Killjoy with BerLIN picking up the Operator on Harbor to strengthen the team's early-round capabilities, forcing a timeout from EDG coach AfteR at 11-11. The timeout proved enough for EDG to reach 12, however, FPX followed up with a 3k from AAAAY to ensure overtime. An OT Operator from ZmjjKK delivered both rounds to EDG with back-to-back opening kills, while another mid lurk from CHICHOO closed out the game 14-12 with EDG taking the series lead 2-1. nobody and CHICHOO both provided excellent performances for their squad with 28 and 26 kills respectively. On the FPX side, BerLIN once again delivered where the rest of his team could not with 27 kills on Harbor while also being the only FPX player with a positive K/D. EDG take the series comfortably on Breeze EDG carried over the energy from Breeze with Haodong picking up an 11-0 K/D start after an anti-eco ace and then a 3K to win the bonus. This forced out a quick timeout from FPX after which they managed to recover with four rounds straight of their own. Bringing out the attacking Operator for ZmjjKK let EDG pick up two more rounds to solidify a 7-5 scoreline. Haodong had a brilliant start on Breeze. Despite losing the second pistol, EDG dropped just a single gun round en route to the trophy. Aggressive map control from the defense combined with a strong Cypher B site hold from CHICHOO went unanswered by FPX as EDG cruised to a 13-8 win on Breeze and a 3-1 win in the series. EDG are back on top in China. ZmjjKK and CHICHOO both had standout performances across all four maps with ZmjjKK's Operator being pivotal for multiple turnarounds in the series. EDG fully built their system around facilitating ZmjjKK and their investment paid off as the Chinese duelist stood atop the server after the series in ACS. EDG's victory in stage one grants them the top seed from China at Masters Shanghai and the ability to skip over the swiss stage with a direct bye into the playoffs, alongside the opportunity to pick their first-round opponent. EDG received three extra championship points as a result of their win to end stage one with 12 points in total while FPX ended the stage with eight. FPX will begin Masters Shanghai in the swiss stage alongside China's third seed, Dragon Ranger Gaming , on May 23rd."

    "cleaned_content": "G2 Esports defeated LEVIATÁN 3-2 in the lower finals of the VCT Americas Stage 1 playoffs. This cements Lev as the third seed from the Americas at Masters Shanghai. G2 will go up against 100 Thieves in the grand finals to decide who will be the region's top seed. The map veto saw G2 choose Bind to be the first map of play, while Lev opted for Breeze. G2's next pick was Icebox, followed by Lev choosing Lotus, leaving Ascent as the decider map. G2 have continued banning Sunset through Stage 1 and that didn't change today either. G2 let Bind slip away in overtime Bind saw Lev get off to a rocky start by losing the pistol and trailing behind at 4-2. However, they found their groove on their attack executes, successfully winning the next four rounds in succession. G2 did derail their momentum by winning the last two rounds to tie the half up at 6-6. What was that last kill from valyn? The side swap saw G2 find a successful attacking pistol win but Lev capitalized and won their full buy to bring the score to 8-7. The teams would continue trading rounds, with G2 getting to match point first at 12-10. Lev would bring it back however, pushing the map into overtime. A 3K from aspas would win Lev the first map in the series. Both teams had a mirror composition, and a key reason for Lev's win would be aspas, who had five first kills as well as 22 frags. Leviatán struggle to break G2's defense on Breeze Despite Breeze being Lev's pick, G2 made full use of their double-controller composition with the Viper and Astra, denying the plant for Lev in the first four rounds. Lev finally won their first round off the back of a 3K from Mazino , but G2 continued to dominate on their defensive side, with Lev only finding two more rounds in the half to end it 9-3. After the side swap, G2 won the pistol, but Lev were able to steal away the anti-eco. Trent with the successful bonus round clutch. Despite Lev showing signs of life, the lead G2 had garnered in the first half was too much for Lev to overcome. G2 won the map 13-7 and tied the teams at one map win apiece. While G2 did struggle a little on the attack thanks to Yoru being their sole duelist, their defensive half, especially the impact that JonahP and valyn both had, were a key reason for the team's 9-3 lead. Leviatán steals away Icebox off of a ninja defuse Icebox, G2's map pick, saw them start on defense once again, and similar to the previous two maps, started strong with a pistol win. They successfully showed their expertise with retakes on the map as they pushed the score to 4-1 in their favor. However, Lev regrouped and began taking more space on the map in the post-plant to prevent retakes from flooding in, winning five more rounds in a row, including one where tex found a 1v3 clutch. G2 recovered a little to end the half 6-6. G2 were able to keep their perfect track record with a pistol round win and anti-eco, but Lev showcased their prowess with the Harbor and Viper composition on the map, pulling off four successive retakes. G2 however bounced back with a round win thanks to a 3K from leaf , and were then able to push the score to 12-11. They put themselves in a winning position with three of their players left standing versus just tex in the last round, but he defused the spike under their noses to push the game to overtime. Pros don't fake (Leviatán edition.) Once again, Lev, fueled by this second chance at winning the map, would deliver. It was again Tex, who clutched another 1v3 to give Leviatán the win 14-12. Both teams looked similar in terms of stats, with aspas and trent being the respective top fraggers. G2 deliver karma with multiple ninja defuses on Lotus Leviatán had chosen Lotus, a map on which they had just gone down to KRU. G2 seemed to sense weakness, and after yet another pistol win, got off to a strong start. They would extend their lead to 5-0 before Lev finally found a round win. After a timeout, Lev seemed to have things under control as they would recover and win three more rounds to end the half 8-4 in G2's favor. Lev won their first pistol of the day and, similar to G2, used it to propel themselves into the lead. They won five straight rounds to bring the score to 9-8 in their favor. However, G2 then figured out how to take advantage of a weak Lev post-plant and found five defuses in the next six rounds, three of which were ninja defuses. Those defuses helped G2 take the map 13-10. Pros don't fake (G2 edition.) While valyn was already the MVP in terms of stats with a 190 ADR and 26 kills on Omen, he was also the MVP for his smokes which allowed his team to win many defensive rounds and push the series to the decider. G2 denies Lev overtime on Ascent to win the series Ascent saw both teams mirroring each other with the meta team comp, and G2 won their ninth pistol of the day. However, some nice shots with the help of kiNgg 's one-way in A main saw Lev steal away the anti-eco round. G2 and Lev traded rounds, bringing the score to 5-3 in G2's favor before Lev buckled down. They didn't even let G2 get the spike down in the next four rounds to close out the half 7-5 with the lead. After the side swap, G2 won the last pistol round of the day thanks to a 1v3 ninja defuse by valyn. Another ninja defuse for G2. This seemed to be the round that broke the camel's back, causing Lev to stumble and letting G2 bring the map back into their favor at 10-9. Lev seemed to recover a little after a 1v2 clutch from C0M, and retook the lead 11-10. G2 would not be denied however, and would win the next three rounds to win Ascent 13-11 and set themselves to face 100 Thieves in the grand final. The MVP of the series was undoubtedly valyn. Not only was he IGL-ing, he also had 101 kills across all five maps on controller, tying with superstar duelist aspas for the honor of the day's top-frag. The entire G2 roster also had far more assists than the Lev side, showcasing the team's ability to play off of each other. G2 dominated the pistol rounds in the series, winning nine out of the ten played, and with the map scores being this close, these rounds were key in ensuring their victory. Leviatán will face 100 Thieves in the regional grand finals to decide who will be the region's top seed at Masters Shanghai. Both teams are tied in terms of championship points with six apiece, and the winner of tomorrow's game will get an additional three points. They will also be the top seed at Masters Shanghai from the Americas league."

    "cleaned_content": "FNATIC beat FUT Esports 3-1 in the lower bracket finals of the VCT EMEA 2024 Stage 1 playoffs . FUT will be the third seed from EMEA heading into Masters Shanghai, while Fnatic will have a rematch against Team Heretics in the regional grand finals. The map veto began with Fnatic picking Icebox first, FUT picking Bind second, and Fnatic choosing Breeze third. FUT then picked Split, leaving Ascent as the potential final map. FUT wins Icebox by stopping a big Fnatic comeback Starting on Icebox, Fnatic were looking to make a statement on a map they had dominated on in the past, but the match began with FUT rolling over Fnatic on their attack side. FUT had the chance to face another Sage variation of the regular Icebox composition, and just like against Karmine Corp the day before, got off to a hot start. After winning the pistol round, FUT only lost their bonus round and the one afterward. Just like their regular season play, FUT built their playbook around getting Mehmet \" cNed \" Yağız İpek into great positions for his Jett to outduel his opponents. However, Fnatic entered the half down 9-3 and almost won the map. The attack side of Fnatic matched the firepower of FUT, with Nikita \" Derke \" Sirmitev reminding everyone that this is one of his best maps. He challenged cNed in Jett duels, ending the map with eight kills on cNed while only dying to him six times. Derke getting a 4K against FUT Esports on Icebox. FUT were able to stop the comeback at the last moment with good retakes to secure the map 13-11, but it got too close for comfort considering the task that Fnatic had in front of them. Bind was the only one-sided map of the series When Bind began, it looked to be the first back-and-forth map of the series, but that was just the first half. Once again, cNed was the spearhead for FUT. He dropped 15 kills in the first half on Raze, while Jake \" Boaster \" Howlett was the one who kept Fnatic tied 6-6 heading into the half. Then, when Fnatic went on attack, it was another masterclass. Just like Icebox, the team looked better coordinated to counter FUT when they pressed the advantage instead of defending against set plays around cNed. Where the first map was all about the duelists, Timofey \" Chronicle \" Khromov and Emir \" Alfajer \" Ali Beder stood out on Bind. Chronicle and Alfajer clear out FUT to win Bind. In the second half of Bind, Alfajer dropped eight kills with only one death on Viper. Fnatic were perfect on attack, closing the map out 13-6. Breeze was the tightest map of the lower finals For the first time in the series, a map went the distance without a team attempting a tough comeback. Breeze had the two teams run mirror compositions asides from their choices on duelist. FUT kept cNed on Jett while Fnatic ran Derke on Yoru, a more common pick now on Breeze. FUT won the first pistol round, and it took a 1v2 clutch from Derke to win Fnatic their first round. Both teams entered the half tied 6-6, and FUT won their second pistol round of the map. Despite losing both pistol rounds, Fnatic kept the game close. It all came down to a crucial round, where Boaster clutched a tense post-plant to tie the series at 11-11. Boaster wins a key round late into Breeze against FUT. Fnatic used that round to keep their economy alive, and that was critical in their next two rounds to complete the map 13-11. Split marked the second attempted comeback for Fnatic FUT needed to come out hot to take the series to map five, and that was exactly what they did on Split. Going back to their Chamber pick, FUT started on defense and were able to counter the double duelist from Fnatic. While Alfajer on Raze did well across both sides, Derke struggled to get value as Yoru on his attack side. With FUT heading into the half up 8-4 and players like Furkan \" MrFaliN \" Yeğen and Doğukan \" qRaxs \" Balaban taking the fragging role off cNed, they then won the second pistol round. Fnatic only won two pistol rounds out of eight attempts, and now needed to come back from a 10-4 deficit. Thankfully, Fnatic have that experience to do those comebacks, as we saw on Icebox earlier this series. They just needed to do it again, and the scenario looked dire when FUT won their first gun round to go up 11-6. Round by round, Fnatic crept up slowly but surely. Just as it looked like FUT got hold of the map up 12-11, Derke won a one health clutch to take the map to overtime. Derke wins a crucial fight on one health to take Split to overtime against FUT. The momentum that was built from clawing back down 10-4 proved too much for FUT. Split ended 14-12, and the series was over. Fnatic beat FUT 3-1, but the match was much closer than a four-map series entails. Fnatic will face Team Heretics in the regional grand finals on May 12 ."

After a 2-1 win, 100 Thieves cemented their spot in the grand final while G2 got knocked into the lower bracket. The second game of the day had LEVIATÁN going up against KRÜ Esports , with the loser eliminated from the event. Lev came out on top with a 2-1 victory and will be the third Americas representative at Masters Shanghai. 100 Thieves take down G2 Both teams had clashed already once this year during the group stage, with 100 Thieves finding a 2-0 win against G2. The map veto saw G2 choose Ascent to open the series with, starting on attack. Both teams opted for the Icebox meta composition, resulting in a mirror matchup. 100 Thieves were able to win the pistol and anti-eco, but G2 bounced back with three rounds of their own off the back of their full-buy. 100 Thieves countered with a triple win of their own, and this back and forth continued until the half concluded 7-5, with 100T having a slight lead. After the side swap, 100 Thieves shifted into high gear, winning their second pistol and continuing their momentum to win the next five rounds and take their opponent's map pick 13-5. Among the Thieves, it was the Sova that stood out with eeiu being the map MVP after a server-high 308 ACS and 192 ADR of 192 performance. Clean executes saw 100 Thieves dominate on attack. Map two saw Bind come up, with G2 opting to start on defense. This was a map 100T had previously beat G2 on, and G2 had since changed their comp up, replacing their Yoru with a more standard Raze and swapping initiators. Things were looking dire for G2 at this point. 100 Thieves won all five of their Stage 1 games on Bind heading into the match. 100 Thieves got off to a strong start again off the back of the pistol round win followed by the anti-eco. G2 won their full buy but 100T won their buy round, then extended their lead to 6-2. Towards the tail end of the half, G2 began playing more for the retake and won the final four rounds to tie up the half evenly. The side swap saw the pistol go to 100 Thieves, but after G2 got their hands on rifles, it was over. On the attack, leaf and valyn went on the warpath, and G2 won the next seven rounds to win Bind 13-8 and push the series to the decider. The scoreboard was pretty evenly distributed with valyn being the match MVP on Brimstone, having 287 ACS and a kill differential of +10 – the server highest. The decider was Split, with 100 Thieves starting on attack. Both teams opted for a double initiator and double controller comp, with 100T choosing Gekko, compared to G2 preferring Breach. G2 started their defensive side with a pistol win thanks to their Raze, icy , having an explosive 3K to start the map with. Both teams continued trading rounds until 100 Thieves took the lead at 4-3. G2 would switch things up however, once again opting for their map two strategy of playing for the retake which would win them the next five rounds to end the half 8-4. The sideswap saw G2 further extend their score to 10-4 by winning the pistol and converting the following round. It seemed almost over for 100 Thieves, but they looked unfazed as they proceeded to demonstrate their almost impenetrable defense. They would win the next six rounds in a row before G2 could win a round off the back of a triple kill from JonahP to bring the score to 11-10 in their favor. However, it was merely a final breath for G2, as 100 Thieves took the next three rounds to deny overtime and take the series 2-1. The winning moment. It's not too out of the ordinary for Cryocells to be the star of 100 Thieves. But today, despite his series-leading 11 kills while playing Jett and two controllers, the team's Sova and Fade player excelled the most. eeiu's KAST was 81% and his ACS was 249 in the series. 100 Thieves looked incredible in terms of utility usage and ultimate management. They consistently were able to keep pressure on G2 despite being down on map three and Boostio 's calling was a key factor. With this win, 100 Thieves are the first grand finalists of VCT Americas. G2, on the other hand, have been knocked down into the lower bracket, and will face off against the winner of Leviatán vs KRÜ to decide who will join 100 Thieves in the grand final. Leviatán find revenge against KRÜ The second series of the day saw the Latin American teams clash against each other for the second time this year. The stakes were considerably higher today, with the winning team heading to Shanghai and the losing team heading home. Leviatán had come out on top the last time during the regular season. The first map of play was Lotus, chosen by Lev. During their last face-off, Lotus had been the decider and Lev had come out on top. Both teams had kept their team comp the same, resulting in a mirror matchup again. The first half was quite back and forth, with Lev starting on defense and winning the pistol and anti-eco. KRÜ looked confident on attack, however, with keznit finding two 3Ks in the third and fourth rounds which eventually culminated in a 6-3 lead. Lev would win another two rounds in the half, but KRÜ maintained their lead as the half concluded 7-5. The last time these two teams fought on Lotus, KRÜ had struggled compared to Lev on defense. This time, KRÜ had come prepared, and with keznit keeping the aggressive pressure up in tandem with heat , Lev couldn't break through. Lev would only win one more round on the map as KRÜ would demonstrate an almost flawless defensive side to claim their opponent's map pick 13-6. Map two was Icebox, KRÜ's pick. They opted for a double-initiator composition, while Lev preferred a double-controller team comp. Neither team could find a significant lead in the first half as they traded rounds back and forth. Despite a brutal 1v4 from aspas in round 10, KRÜ closed out the half 7-5 after winning the final two rounds of the half. They would also win the second pistol in the half, but Lev's defense looked incredibly strong. With the Harbor and Viper walls consistently cycling, KRÜ were hard-pressed to break through, and would only win two buy rounds in the entire half. Tex, the underrated fragger on Lev has been putting up numbers. Lev would win the map narrowly, 13-11, and the key reason would be Aspas' consistency in fragging, with two 4Ks and three 3Ks over the map contributing to a 314 ACS and +13 kill differential. The series decider was Sunset, with Lev starting on defense. Both teams once again mirrored each other's agent compositions. Lev had a great start, converting the pistol as well as the following two rounds, but Shyy found a crucial 1v3 clutch to win a thrifty for KRÜ. After this, KRÜ continued to win, converting the next seven rounds. Lev would find the final two rounds in the half, finally derailing KRÜ's momentum and ending the half 7-5 in Lev's favor. Lev switched to attack, and they used their Raze-Breach-Gekko core in perfect synergy to consistently find picks and open up sites. They won six rounds in a row, bringing the score to 11-5 before KRÜ finally pulled off a successful retake to win a defensive round, but the damage had been done. KRÜ would not win any more rounds as Lev closed out Sunset 13-8, eliminating KRÜ from the playoffs and qualifying for Masters Shanghai. Time to book your flight tickets to Shanghai, Leviatán. Throughout the series, Aspas was the star duelist for Lev. Despite how close the series had been, he had a kill differential of +21. VCT Americas representatives at Masters Shanghai confirmed With the conclusion of today's games, 100 Thieves, G2 Esports, and Leviatán are the three teams that will be representing the Americas at Masters Shanghai. Seeding is yet to be decided and will depend upon the next two games. G2 and Lev will face off in the lower bracket final, and the winner will get a chance at revenge against 100 Thieves in the grand final."

Team Heretics also beat FNATIC in the upper finals, cementing their spot in their second regional grand finals in 2024. Team Heretics stomp Fnatic to head to regional grand finals Team Heretics picked Lotus and Fnatic picked Breeze, leaving Split as the potential third map. Lotus was the most entertaining map of the day, due to both Heretics and Fnatic having strong performances on the map with different compositions. Heretics opted for a double initiator comp, while Fnatic stuck to their double controller comp. The game began with Timofey \" Chronicle \" Khromov and Nikita \" Derke \" Sirmitev leading Fnatic to a 5-1 lead, but Benjamin \" benjyfishy \" David Fish helped stop their early run. That led to a tied 6-6 half, and the second half was one of momentum. Fnatic won their second pistol and converted their bonus for the second time, yet Heretics took four rounds in a row to keep the map close and take it to overtime. Despite the fact that nobody on Heretics was doing well with first kills, their patience and coordination allowed them to take the map 15-13. Then came Breeze, a map that revolves heavily around getting the first kill, and Heretics were planning entirely around that. Heretics used their Yoru and KAY/O to secure those early kills often, preventing Fnatic from gaining information without losing a player or two. Wo0t securing some early kills against Fnatic. While map one was the land of benjyfishy, map two was a true team effort. The two Turkish players on Heretics stepped up, as both Mert \" Wo0t \" Alkan and Enes \" RieNs \" Ecirli finished with 18 kills each on KAY/O and Sova respectively. An 8-4 defense half for Heretics turned into a perfect attack side to close out the map 13-4. Team Heretics move on to the grand finals of the EMEA Stage 1 playoffs, while Fnatic will have another chance at the EMEA Stage 1 title through the lower bracket. FUT Esports defeat Karmine Corp to go to Shanghai While the first match of the day only mattered for bragging rights and potential circuit points, the second match was a win-and-in scenario. Either Karmine Corp would keep their chance to fight internationally, or FUT Esports would take their reinvigorated roster to Shanghai. Karmine Corp picked Icebox, FUT picked Sunset, leaving Lotus as the final map if needed. Icebox began with Martin \" marteen \" Pátek picking up the Reyna, running down mid on pistols to get two early picks and the early lead. KC ran the Reyna without Gekko, passing on the double flash instead for a Sage to slow down their opponents. FUT instead ran a regular Jett, KAY/O, Viper, Sova, and Killjoy comp. Despite losing pistol, FUT used their kit to empower Mehmet \" cNed \" Yağız İpek on Jett and helped him get some crucial first kills. KC were playing a lot slower than expected in their retakes, partly due to Marshall \" N4RRATE \" Massey moving from Gekko to Sova. FUT then used the ultimates they built up to get easy round wins, and it was a quick 10-2 lead. FUT Esports clean up to end a 10-2 half on Icebox. Despite the fact that Icebox was their map pick, KC lost it in significant fashion. An anti-eco conversion from FUT thanks to a flank from Eray \" yetujey \" Budak was the final nail in the coffin for Icebox. The 13-3 score was rough for KC, putting all the pressure on them for map two. With Sunset next up, KC put N4RRATE back on Gekko. KC won their third pistol round of the series, looking more comfortable with this composition than the one they introduced on Icebox. FUT still proved tough to get past on gun rounds, having a solid lead at the half. Down 8-4, KC needed a stalwart defense to keep themselves alive in the series. KC won their fourth pistol round, the first step on a needed comeback. A bonus conversion was the second step, which N4RRATE helped secure. KC then fumbled some key rounds, including losing a 2v1 and not clearing corners on a late retake. It was all yetujey and cNed on Sunset, who both finished with more than 21 kills. FUT took the map 13-10 and the series 2-0. Across the series, FUT outdueled KC. Only one person on KC got over 28 kills. For comparison, FUT had four players get more than 28 kills, and that was thanks to their great aim on eco rounds. FUT Esports will be the third EMEA team to make it to Masters Shanghai, and will face Fnatic in the lower final of the Stage 1 playoffs. Karmine Corp are eliminated from Masters Shanghai contention, and will be seen next in Stage 2 regional play."

    "cleaned_content": "With Sentinels and LOUD out of the tournament, the Americas was set up to send three new teams to international competition at Masters Shanghai. G2 Esports and 100 Thieves became the first two teams to qualify in an explosive day of play. It was a phenomenal surge for a G2 lineup that squeaked into playoffs, just three rounds from being eliminated outright in the group stage. They took down KRÜ Esports , who topped their group but couldn't keep up their form into the playoffs. A surging 100T took down LEVIATÁN in one of the best matches of the year to secure North America's second berth. G2 punch through KRÜ KRÜ and G2 weren't exactly unfamiliar with each other coming into their playoff match. Placed in the same group during Americas Kickoff, they faced off twice to start the year. G2 won both matches to eliminate KRÜ before they had a chance to face any other team. Both teams swapped out a player since then. G2 brought in a young duelist, icy, while KRÜ finally unlocked heat's star potential in his first time playing away from the duelist role and Brazilian rosters. G2 came into Icebox firing on all cylinders. They jumped out to an 8-4 lead on defense on the back of immaculate retakes on the A site. An early Outlaw buy from leaf punished KRÜ's light armor preference, and kept their economy on the back foot all game. Thats about how well this entire map went for KRÜ. After putting up superstar numbers all split, keznit finally had a stinker of a game for KRÜ. His seven kills marked the lowest kill total he reached all year by far. KRÜ's inability to get any sort of an advantageous situation towards A led them to a handful of difficult round wins towards B where G2's anchors were sometimes caught off-guard. Down 6-2, they had a great opportunity to threaten a comeback in the half before leaf and trent landed a 2v5 retake on B. With the wind knocked out of their sails, KRÜ quickly folded. G2 easily ran away with the map 13-5. leaf led the way with more triple-kills (4) than all of KRÜ combined (3). Despite a pistol round win, Ascent also started poorly for KRÜ. They rarely offered defensive resistance at the extremities of the map and gambled incorrectly when they did. That handed G2 the perfect staging ground to set up their site executes, and they executed efficiently to jump out to a 6-3 lead. This wasn't the first time G2 had a large early lead on Ascent. Just the day before, they threw away a 6-1 lead against Cloud9 in a game that went to overtime. Similarly to that game, they allowed KRÜ a late half surge. Facing a map that was spiraling out of their control, KRÜ used their ultimates perfectly to turn the tides. Retaking on A, they purposefully offset the Lockdown to avoid counter-utility breaking it. G2 were pushed into a tiny corner in Wine where they were slaughtered by a Hunter's Fury. Beautiful Valorant. KRÜ used that momentum to bulldoze to an 8-6 lead. The spark of dynamic aggression that boosted them to the top seed of their stacked group looked like it had returned for a brief moment. Unfortunately for LATAM fans, the flames didn't catch, and G2 quickly reasserted control. Incredible teamplay gave G2 several dominant rounds in a row to shut out KRÜ the rest of the way to a 13-8 victory. It was a complete team showing with every member of G2 finishing in the green, while every member of KRÜ ended in the red. This win guaranteed G2 a spot in Shanghai. The last time this core reached an international event was back at Reykjavik 2022 under The Guard's banner. They may have a chance to reunite with their former teammate, Sayplayer, if they get matched up against T1. 100T take down LEV 100T and LEV were also familiar opponents from Kickoff. LEV took their matchup to start the year, but both teams got bounced by eventual finalists LOUD and SEN. LEV ran away with the top seed in their group off the back of one of the most dominant individual runs of all time from aspas, but 100T came into the game with incredible momentum after blowing out LOUD in their best performance of the year. The hometown heroes kept their momentum going heading into this match. By the time LEV realized Bind had started, it was already over. Everything 100T tried simply worked, from Judge rushes to ratty angles. After talking a big game in pre-match press, Boostio backed up his trash talk by winning back-to-back clutches against his former world champion teammate, C0M. He did say he was going to dominate C0M. 100T found the key to unraveling LEV. By keeping aspas in check, they forced someone else from LEV to step up and win critical fights, but nobody was able to. The player that set the Americas kill record was held to 11-14, and that was the top of his team. Boostio was standing up and setting the atmosphere of the entire arena throughout Bind, and he got right back into it on Sunset with a pistol ace. One man owns this arena. The main difference from Bind was that the highest rated player in the Americas came back online. aspas found multikills in each of the first four rounds, including rounds that LEV lost. Nearly every round, even the eco rounds, had back and forth battles, but LEV kept coming out on top for a five round winning streak. It took a ninja defuse from 100T to stem the bleeding, and a 1v3 clutch from Asuna salvaged a fourth round in the half. It looked like 100T had finished stretching the limits of competitiveness after LEV won three easy rounds to reach an 11-4 lead on their attack without facing much resistance. However, 100T found their second win and took round after round with simple and unstoppable hits towards B. LEV only managed to pull off a retake once in nine rounds, and the 100T rampage forced overtime. With pressure building, LEV finally found the answer. Mazino dominated with seven kills in the extra frame to send the series to Icebox. During 100T's stomp of LOUD on Icebox, Cryocells' round three Operator set the pace for the entire map. He bought it this time as well and immediately made the big gun sing with a no-scope. Thank you random number generator. LEV moved to stop the Op slaughter with a utility heavy blitz towards A.. While it worked initially, he kept buying it and punishing LEV's slower actions. The nerves were clearly starting to get to people. After winning the pistol, LEV ran into a Sheriff massacre the next round. 100T gave them a round back when eeiu accidentally failed to stick the spike plant, giving C0M enough time to run up and win the clutch. The back and forth battle for Icebox control led to an incredible sequence where both teams tied at four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten rounds apiece. Now THAT'S how you end a series. In the end, 100T rose to the occasion to close the map 13-10 and secure their place at Shanghai. Cryocells outshined aspas with a map leading 26 kills, although both duelists dominated the opening duel tallies. Across the series, aspas put up a good fight, landing 55 kills and a 16-8 first blood record, but the dynamic duo of Cryocells and Asuna proved too much for LEV to handle. KRÜ and LEV will face off on Friday, May 10 to determine the third and final team to qualify to Shanghai from the Americas. G2 and 100T will also face off in the upper finals that day. Although they have both already qualified, the top seed gets a bye straight to the playoffs of Shanghai and the tantalizing potential to select their first round opponent."

    "cleaned_content": "The first two days of the VCT China 2024 Stage 1 Playoffs saw Nova Esports and All Gamers eliminated from Shanghai contention while FunPlus Phoenix and EDward Gaming confirmed their spots at the event. The remaining matches will determine seeding as well as the final qualified team. Trace Esports defeat All Gamers 2-0 Trace Esports and All Gamers faced off for the first time since Trace beat them in 2023. All Gamers have completely revamped their roster since then, while Trace has only replaced a single player. Trace Esports were seeded higher in group Omega, while All Gamers were behind them in terms of round differential. The series started on Sunset, chosen by Trace Esports. Both teams ran a mirrored composition. Starting on defense, Trace got off to a good start after taking the pistol and anti-eco round. All Gamers were able to win their buy round but the momentum shifted firmly to Trace as the team converted four rounds in a row. AG only won three more rounds in the half, which concluded 8-4 in Trace's favor. Trace were quite successful in their retakes, winning five out of eight of them. While All Gamers put up a fight, almost catching up to Trace at 10-9, Trace would ultimately take the map. The star for the map were their support players, with Kai, their Cypher top fragging. Trace Esports took down All Gamers 2-0. All Gamers chose Breeze, where they ran a double controller comp with a Viper and Harbor alongside a Yoru as their sole duelist. Trace on the other hand had just a solitary Viper, with a Jett and Yoru. Starting on attack, this double-duelist comp once again found a strong pistol and anti-eco win. This time, they also converted a bonus win and coasted off the momentum to end the half 9-3. While AG tried to come back into the series by winning the next four out of five rounds, bringing the score to 10-7, Trace won the next three rounds in a row to take the map 13-7 and the series 2-0, knocking All Gamers out of the playoffs. Kai was the MVP of the series, switching between Cypher and Jett and averaging 285 ACS. He also had a kill differential of +21, the highest on the server by far. After their win, Trace Esports were to play FunPlus Phoenix next in the upper finals. Dragon Rangers eliminate Nova Esports Both teams had never faced off before and had been part of Group Alpha. Dragon Ranger Gaming were higher seeded with a win record of 3-3, while Nova Esports sat at 2-4. Nova Esports chose the first map of play to be Bind, opting for a triple initiator composition, while DRG ran the more conventional Brim-Viper-Skye core seen on the map. The map started with Nova winning the pistol and the following round. DRG won their full buy and the following. The map continued in a see-saw fashion. DRG found their pace in the last three rounds in the half, winning them with good retakes and ending the half 6-6. After switching to attack, DRG would ride on their prior momentum to win four in a row and only lose two more rounds, taking the map 13-8. The hero for DRG on this map was vo0kashu on Cypher, who net 30 kills and an ACS of 402. DRG vo0kashu did not miss. https://www.twitch.tv/valorantesports_cn/clip/MistyMiniatureOtterTwitchRPG-ULVPH2NRAD4hSwt0 Map 2 was DRG's pick, Ascent, where they started well with a pistol win and anti-eco on attack. Nova countered by winning their buy then followed up with another three rounds until DRG were able to pull their attack together. DRG won five out of the next six rounds to conclude the half 7-5 in their favor. Nova Esports tied things up after a pistol win, their third in the series, but DRG kicked things into high gear by winning the next six rounds and the map 13-7. The series MVP was vo0kashu on Cypher, with a kill differential of +24 and an ACS of 351. While four out of five players on DRG went positive in terms of KD, none of Nova could manage the same. With their 2-0 win, DRG made it to the upper semifinals to face EDG, while Nova were eliminated. FunPlus Phoenix confirms Masters Shanghai berth after defeating Trace Esports FunPlus Phoenix took on Trace Esports in the upper semifinal. While FPX had directly made it to the playoffs semifinals thanks to them being the top seed in group Omega, Trace had to beat All Gamers to make it. Both teams faced off for the first time since Kickoff, where FPX had found the win. Map one, chosen by Trace, saw the teams head to Bind. Both teams had similar comps differing in their choice of initiators–while FPX opted for Kayo, Trace preferred Skye. Trace Esports had a strong start, winning the pistol. FPX converted their full buy and the following round but Trace would go on to win six out of the next eight rounds and ended the half 10-2. However, FPX bounced back with four rounds in a row, and they continued their domination. FPX took the map 13-10, thanks to Life's consistent entries and multifrags coupled with AAAAY's support in terms of both utility and trades. The second map was Lotus, FPX's pick. They started strong, with a 7-2 lead on the defensive side. Autumn on the Viper was a key to their strong defensive start, with both his toxic screens and consistent kills helping ensure FPX were able to hold and retake sites consistently. However, Trace would recover to win the last three rounds, ending the half 7-5. Trace won the second pistol, but FPX stole away the anti-eco and then won two rounds, bringing the score to 9-6. FPX expanded on their lead further to win the map 13-8. Even in a 3v5, FPX didn't slow down. Both teams performed well across the scoreboard in terms of kills, although four out of five FPX players went positive while only one of Trace could manage the same. With this win, FPX have qualified for Masters Shanghai, while Trace will face DRG in the lower semifinal. FPX will go up against EDG in the upper final. EDward Gaming take down Dragon Rangers to qualify for Shanghai The second qualification game for Masters Shanghai saw Dragon Rangers Gaming face EDward Gaming. EDG, like FPX, had directly qualified for this playoff game since they topped group Alpha, while DRG had defeated Nova Esports to make it to the upper semifinal. Dragon Gaming chose the first map, which was Ascent. Despite it being their opponent's pick, EDG tore through them on the attack, winning five rounds straight. DRG were able to convert two more rounds, but it was a mere pause in EDG's domination as the half ended 9-3. After the side swap, EDG won four rounds in a row to take the map 13-3. ZmjjKK was the MVP, with a massive 407 ACS and 24 kills. He was able to consistently find entries for the team in the first half and was a key factor in why they excelled on the attack. Map two was EDG's pick, Split, where DRG got off to a better start. They won six out of the first eight rounds on defense but after a round where EDG saved their guns, EDG were able to find three rounds in a row. The half ended 7-5 in favor of DRG. After the side swap, DRG looked like they had things in control after winning the pistol and anti-eco, getting the score to 9-5. This would be the last round that DRG would win in the series. EDG won the next eight rounds in a row to win the map 13-9 and the series 2-0. KangKang is a force of nature. ZmjjKK was the undoubted MVP of the series with an ACS of 331 and a kill differential of +16. With this win, EDG have qualified for Masters Shanghai, while DRG will face Trace in the lower semifinal. EDG and FPX return to the international stage EDward Gaming and FPX both qualified for Masters Madrid, but neither team made the playoffs, although EDG found a win against PRX during the group stage. EDG and FPX will now fight for a spot in the grand finals in the upper final. The lower bracket game between Trace and DRG will decide who the third Chinese team to qualify for Shanghai is. The seeding is yet to be decided."

    "cleaned_content": "This article has been updated to include information pertaining to regional league winners. Riot has revealed new details ahead of this year's second international event, Masters: Shanghai . The biggest change includes the introduction of first seeds picking their playoff opponents. After breaking viewership records at Masters: Madrid , Riot highlighted its vision for the upcoming Masters tournament which included more teams, larger venues, and a twist to the pre-playoffs stage of the event. To begin, the newly-introduced Swiss Stage format from Madrid will be re-used at Shanghai. Teams will fight to secure a threshold of wins before they accumulate a certain amount of losses. Spain's international required teams to win two matches before they lost two in order to advance out of the Swiss Stage. The next game-changing detail revealed by Riot was the introduction of first seeds from regional leagues selecting their playoff opponents. Currently, all four regional leagues are in the process of determining their Shanghai representatives. However, a new incentive outside of the three Championship Points is on the line for the first-place winner. The winners of the regional leagues will not only secure a BYE to playoffs at Shanghai, but they will also be able to pick their opponents right after the Swiss Stage concludes ahead of playoffs. The order of the process for the four teams will be randomly drawn. Finally, Riot has also revealed the venue for the finals of Shanghai, which will take place at the Mercedes Benz Arena from June 7-9. This is the largest venue utilized in VCT history, leaving more opportunities for fans to see their favorite teams perform in person. Currently, seven of the 12 teams traveling to China have been determined, with the other five set to solidify by May 10. Masters: Shanghai kicks off on May 23 as what may be the most interesting international yet."

This leaves one more international slot for KC and FUT to fight over in the lower bracket. With this win, Fnatic are back in international play after missing out on Madrid. As for FUT, their rise to success in Stage 1 was mitigated by a Team Heretics squad who finally worked out the issues after adjusting their roster after Madrid. Fnatic sweep Karmine Corp to get their revenge from Kickoff Heading into the 2024 season, there was little reason to point to Fnatic losing to Karmine Corp back at the EMEA Kickoff. It happened nonetheless, and Fnatic took that as motivation to try harder in their rematch, sweeping KC to make it to Shanghai. The map draft began with Fnatic picking Breeze and Karmine Corp picking Bind, leaving Lotus as the potential deciding map. Map one started with KC hitting all their shots, which mattered on Breeze and its open sight lines more than most other maps. Running the double duelist with Jett and Yoru, it was Martin \" marteen \" Pátek that stood out with five first-kills and 13 kills at the half. KC were up 9-3, but nothing could foretell the attack half Fnatic would have. The double duelist proved tough on defense for KC, as Fnatic converted a pistol win into a bonus conversion. Leo \" Leo \" Jannesson , Emir \" Alfajer \" Ali Beder , and Timofey \" Chronicle \" Khromov all got over 11 kills each. The map ended 13-11 for Fnatic, with KC only winning two rounds all half. Bind was a near mirror matchup, with the only difference between the two teams being their secondary controller choice. Much like Breeze, it was a battle of who could attack better. KC started on attack, going up 8-4 on more marteen entry kills and good teamwork with Tomás \" tomaszy \" Machado . Alas, when Fnatic got their attack side, it was another lead blown for KC and another near-perfect second half for Fnatic. KC only won one round, and Nikita \" Derke \" Sirmitev truly returned to form with 19 kills on the map. The map ended 13-9, completing the 2-0 sweep for the two-time international winners. Fnatic will face Team Heretics in the upper finals on May 10, while Karmine Corp will have one more chance in the lower bracket finals to qualify for Masters Shanghai. Team Heretics stop the momentum of FUT Esports The second match of the day began with Team Heretics picking Lotus and FUT picking Split, leaving Sunset as the potential deciding map. Lotus saw the return of the composition that FUT loved to run in Stage 1: no initiator, with Sage, Cypher, and Omen. Team Heretics ran Enes \" RieNs \" Ecirli on Breach, trying to use his stuns and flashes to counter the firepower of Mehmet \" cNed \" Yağız İpek and his Operator. A 6-6 half continued into a close map, with FUT and their Sage disrupting the planned setups of Team Heretics. It was a crucial timeout and some amazing shots from ReiNs swung the map for Heretics. The map ended 13-10, giving FUT their first loss on Lotus in Stage 1. For Split, FUT decided to move cNed onto Chamber while Heretics kept their standard Split composition the same. Heretics started hot on defense after winning pistol and converting the bonus round. RieNs continued his form from map one, while the team stifled any plays that FUT threw their way. FUT did adapt with better post-plant setups, but Team Heretics kept the lead at 7-5. The second half began with FUT tying the map after winning pistol, taking a small late lead thanks to cNed's Operator. cNed gets three crucial Operator kills late on Split. Team Heretics took a crucial timeout and extended the map to overtime off of another key 4K from Benjamin \" benjyfishy \" David Fish . Overtimes were traded, and the highlight of the game was when benjyfishy refused to lose with a second clutch 4K . Team Heretics took that momentum and clutched map two 15-13 to get the second 2-0 sweep of the day. Team Heretics have qualified for Masters Shanghai and will face Fnatic in the upper bracket finals on May 10. FUT Esports will fight Karmine Corp for the final EMEA slot at Masters Shanghai."

    "cleaned_content": "FNATIC and Team Heretics eliminated Team Liquid and Natus Vincere from the VCT EMEA 2024 Stage 1 playoffs as well as Masters Shanghai contention. This concludes the single-elimination portion of the tournament, with the remaining four teams fighting for three slots at Masters Shanghai. Fnatic survive a close game against Team Liquid Team Liquid started off the series by picking Ascent, leading to Fnatic picking Icebox, leaving the decider as Lotus. The only difference between the two compositions was at the sentinel role, with Fnatic running Killjoy while Team Liquid ran Cypher. Starting on defense, Team Liquid came out swinging, winning pistols and playing very coordinately. Ending the half up 9-3, every player on TL had at least 10 kills, with Ayaz \" nAts \" Akhmetshin showing off his strength on his signature agent Cypher. Alas, the momentum swung back to Fnatic on their defense, with Timofey \" Chronicle \" Khromov stepping up. Fnatic got the map win 13-11, with Chronicle on KAY/O getting five first kills to lead the map above both Jett players. Then came Icebox, a map Fnatic historically have dominated teams on. Their start was slow, especially considering that Team Liquid ran a rare comp. Across VCT, there has been a lot of experimentation for Icebox compositions, and TL ran Sage, Chamber, and Reyna. Fnatic also ran Sage, but they struggled to get past the defense that TL set up. In particular, Elias \" Jamppi \" Olkkonen on Chamber was getting the first pick often, leading to many rounds Fnatic had to try and win down 4v5. Similarly to map one, Fnatic did come back to take the map to overtime with a strong defense of their own, but two quick round wins and a great performance from former Fnatic player Enzo \" Enzo \" Mestari led to a tied series and map three. Lotus was the only one-sided map of the series, with Fnatic ending the half up 11-1. At that point, it was a formality. Finishing the map 13-5 and the series 2-1, both Leo \" Leo \" Jannesson and Chronicle were crucial to their perfect retakes and stalwart defense. The Fnatic of old were back for the final map, despite the slow starts that almost cost them the series on Ascent and Icebox. Fnatic will face Karmine Corp in the upper bracket semifinals on May 9 to see who automatically qualifies for Masters Shanghai and who gets sent to the lower bracket. Team Heretics shut down NAVI for the second time Team Heretics gave NAVI a bit of déjà vu by preventing the latter from making it to international play in a sweep for the second time this year. This sweep was closer than the previous time at the EMEA Kickoff semifinals , where NAVI got stomped on Breeze. There was no Breeze this time around, as Team Heretics picked Lotus and NAVI picked Split, leaving Bind as the potential deciding third map. Lotus was tight from start to finish, with both teams having their moments. Pontus \" Zyppan \" Eek was the standout from NAVI on Raze, while Enes \" RieNs \" Ecirli on Breach was both fragging and setting up easy kills for his teammates. A 7-5 lead at the half for NAVI turned into a 13-11 map win for Team Heretics, mainly thanks to a strong attack half from Benjamin \" benjyfishy \" David Fish on Cypher. He helped take the pressure off of Dominykas \" MiniBoo \" Lukaševičius , who had a tough time getting first kills on their attack side. Heading into Split, NAVI had another solid first half. They headed into their defense tied up 6-6, a solid attack half for a defense-sided map. Alas, one thing they weren't able to do was to put out benjyfishy, who continued his form from map one into a stellar map two. On Cypher, he topped the scoreboard with 28 kills but split it evenly between both halves. benjyfishy getting a 4K on Split against NAVI. Somehow, with a composition that allowed for both Omen and Raze to play aggressively, it was the Cypher that finished with three first kills, no first deaths, and 332 ACS. He managed to match Zyppan in first kills with six fewer deaths on the most defensive role in the game. With this 2-0 win, Team Heretics will face FUT Esports in the upper bracket semifinals on May 9 . One team will qualify for Masters Shanghai and face the winner of Fnatic and Karmine Corp, while the other will face the loser for their final chance to make it to Shanghai."

    "cleaned_content": "After a tumultuous first split, the Americas playoffs kicked off with back to back knockout matches. G2 Esports started the day by eliminating Cloud9 , and 100 Thieves followed up with an absolutely dominant curbstomping of LOUD . Despite going 5-1 throughout the cross-group games, Cloud9 still got stuck in a single elimination playoff match. All of their regular season victories were dashed in a single series that ended their hopes at their first international qualification since 2021. After a top-four finish at Masters Madrid, LOUD will not even be attending Masters Shanghai. Despite their struggles at the start of the split, they looked like a world class team in their run to clinch a playoff berth. All that improvement vanished against a Cryocells masterclass. G2 take down Cloud9 Initially, Cloud9 looked comfortable on Lotus. icy or leaf took a first death in each of the first five rounds as G2 struggled to break open the A site. Cloud9 traded each other out well to convert the first four advantages. Good vibes. Cloud9's fifth advantage looked to be going the same way, but icy finally had something to say. He landed a 1v3 clutch which completely flipped the switch on the momentum. From then on, Cloud9 looked lifeless. With their economy stabilizing, G2 put on a clinic, losing only two more rounds the rest of the way. An Oxy 4K became C9's last gasp of competitiveness throughout the stomp. IGL valyn led the way for G2, putting up the most kills and fewest deaths in the server. Despite a cumulative 2-8 record in opening duels, icy and leaf still chipped in their fair share of kills. Many teams have tried to modify the entrenched Ascent meta this year, but Skye has not been a significant part of that equation. Even before Skye got nerfed, she had next to no presence on Ascent. Cloud9 sacrificing mainstays like Sova and KAY/O for Skye and Viper gave them an agent composition with a lot of question marks. Those question marks persisted throughout the start of their defense. They were completely unable to fend off G2 from either site. After cruising to multiple effortless postplants, G2 took a 6-1 lead. That one round came from a 1v2 clutch from Runi to deny trent an ace. This time it was G2's turn to crumble. Cloud9 got a little more proactive around the map and started to find success in the earlier fights. G2 barely managed to secure the lead heading into halftime. The momentum continued into the second half. Cloud9 overcame a nasty Classic barrage from leaf to take the pistol round, and snowballed to a 10-8 lead. My classic doesn't work like that. With another late collapse bearing down on them, G2 finally dug their heels in. They somewhat surprisingly burned a Lockdown in a 3v1 retake against vanity to tie the game, and immediately felt that absence in the following round which Cloud9 won. However, the back and forth battle for control still led to overtime. Both teams continued to look weaker on defense. In two extra innings, the attackers got into clean postplant setups. It came down to whoever could pull off a retake first. In the end, G2 closed the map 15-13 to take the series. Despite the close scoreline, G2 dominated the statsheet. The victors went +19 across the series, a stat that is typically indicative of a more comfortable victory. Although G2's new acquisition, icy, had struggled throughout the season, he stepped up in a big way in his first playoff experience. He notched a map-leading 26 kills and eight first bloods. Although Cloud9 didn't get their way in the server, they did manage to score some points out of the server . Their five regular season wins carry over to the second split where they will have a head start on most of their competitors for stage 2 playoff qualification. 100T knock out LOUD Using Breach, an unconventional choice on Bind, LOUD pushed the pace early on their attack. Their flash-heavy blitzing style netted them easy site executes to take the first three rounds. Having used up all their energy to burst out of the gate, LOUD promptly fell apart. 100T ripped off eight rounds in a row in completely dominant fashion. The hero of the first half was undoubtedly Cryocells. He landed four triples and one quadrakill to reach 23 kills in just 12 rounds. For reference, more than half of all players in the Americas failed to reach 23 kills in a full map across the 70 maps played all regular season. Winning both pistols gave LOUD a chance, but their inability to win a single full-buy doomed them. 100T ran away with a 13-6 victory that felt nowhere near as close as the final score suggested. Asuna finished just two kills behind Cryocells' final kill total of 25 by the end; however, his 16 deaths doubled Cryo's tally. Just in case LOUD thought the Cryocells nightmare had finally ended, the superstar showed up once again on Icebox. 100T dominated the first two rounds, then got Cryocells' Operator online. Four LOUD players were bereft of kills through the first four rounds. For Less and Quick, that trend extended all the way through the seventh round. Nobody could stop the Cryocells rampage, and he finished the first half with five triple kills and a 19-4 scoreline. Somebody stop this man. A pistol win only delayed the inevitable, and 100T easily took the series with a 13-4 victory. Across both maps, LOUD only had nine rounds where they bought over 20,000 credits, and they lost all nine of them. Cryocells finished the series with an absurd 1.78 rating and a significantly higher kill differential than any kill total from LOUD's players. He was 12-0 in duels against Less to keep LOUD's young superstar from finding a foothold. Despite a world fourth place finish and Americas playoff qualification in stage 1, LOUD have a measly two circuit points to show for it, and will have an uphill battle to qualify to Champions since they will carry their 2-3 regular season record into the second split. G2 will face KRÜ Esports and 100T will face LEVIATÁN in Masters qualification matches. Both matches take place on Thursday, May 9."

Regional favorites EDward Gaming and FunPlus Phoenix remain at the top, while Trace Esports , Dragon Ranger Gaming , All Gamers , and Nova Esports are all fighting for their chance to represent their country on an international stage. Notably, FunPlus Phoenix are an undefeated 5-0 after beating EDG 2-1 in the regular season. That was EDG's only loss, finishing the regular season at 4-1. The region was top-heavy in Stage 1, as the top two teams finished with a +50 round differential or better. Three different teams qualified for playoffs with a negative round differential. Three teams qualified with three wins, with Nova Esports as the only playoff team with a losing 2-4 record. The best match of VCT China 2024 Stage 1 Due to the parity of Stage 1, the best match was between EDward Gaming and FunPlus Phoenix in week four . Each team dominated a map, showing off how these teams seem to be in a different tier in comparison to the rest of the region. It began with a 13-4 on Breeze for EDG, a close 13-11 win for FPX on Bind, and a 13-4 for FPX on Ascent to close it out. Qu \" Life \" Donghao (瞿东豪) had one of his best VCT games so far, dropping 58 kills across the series. Not only that, but he had 48 of those kills in the final two maps. While his teammate Kale \" Autumn \" Dunne played Yoru on Breeze, Life played Yoru on Ascent and completely shut down EDG. He ended that map with 339 ACS, the highest across all players in the series. This series also proved a key weakness for EDG: predictability. Despite the potential of the roster, EDG ran the default Ascent composition with Jett, KAY/O, Killjoy, and Omen. FPX countered everything EDG threw at them with Viper, Yoru, and Fade to disrupt any planned executes. FPX has always been creative with their ideas, but this win over EDG proved that it was more than just a gimmick if they could execute it right. Now both of these teams will have to take their momentum and get to Shanghai though the playoffs. Stars of VCT China 2024 Stage 1 For standout players in the region, there will always be one duelist that stands out in China. Zheng \" ZmjjKK \" Yongkang (郑永康) , better known as KangKang, remains a top duelist in the world. His ability to play both Jett and Raze at a high level while flexing over to the KAY/O when needed is crucial to their map pool. His stats in China were absurd, with an average of 285.9 ACS, a 1.42 K:D ratio, and one kill per round. EDG rightly design their composition to play around KangKang, a strategy that has netted them regional success. At the same time, two players from FPX deserve their respect after helping the team go undefeated and topple EDG. First off, Life has proven himself one of the few duelists who can fight KangKang blow for blow, second in ACS at 259.3 and a 1.30 K:D. Another sneaky improvement that was key to FPX was Liang \" Lysoar \" Youhao (梁优好) . His ACS might not be as high as the two duelists higher on this list, but his K:D of 1.54 led the region. As a controller for FPX, he also finished fourth in KPR at 0.84. Statistically, he was the best regional controller main in Stage 1, able to stay alive longest and get plenty of impactful kills across their matches.

    "cleaned_content": "VCT Americas Stage 1 has wrapped up with six teams advancing to playoffs. The teams were undecided until the final game concluded as the round differential would decide if G2 Esports or Sentinels qualified. From Group Alpha, KRÜ Esports , Cloud9 , and G2 qualified, while Group Omega was topped by Leviatán, followed by 100 Thieves and LOUD . Of the six teams, only LOUD played in Masters Madrid, and despite them beating G2, the latter squeaked over SEN into the playoffs thanks to round differential. Evil Geniuses faced a similar fate to Sentinels in the other group, being bested by LOUD. Throughout the entire split, KRÜ and Leviatán looked incredibly consistent in terms of performance. Both teams only lost a game apiece and had a round differential of greater than 20 over the next team in their respective groups. The two teams went head to head, with Leviatán finding victory after a close three-map series. They advance as top seeds directly to the upper semifinals. Key Moments The first two weeks of the league saw KRÜ, NRG, and Cloud9 win both their games. Over the next two weeks, KRÜ and Cloud9 would expand on this early lead. Before the final week, both teams had qualified for playoffs, with the former undefeated and the latter only having lost once to 100 Thieves. Leviatán had also confirmed their advance with a 4-1 record, but the final three spots were anyone's grab. For Group Alpha, the third spot could be taken by NRG, Sentinels, or G2. While NRG and G2 were at a record of 3-2, SEN had a 2-3 record. Their upcoming games as well as the round differential would play a huge role in who qualified. SEN won their game against FURIA, keeping their playoff hopes alive while NRG's 2-0 loss to 100 Thieves saw them unlikely to qualify. The final spot in Group Alpha came down to whether LOUD could defeat G2 with a round differential of less than 12, and they couldn't. G2 locked in the final playoffs slot of the group over SEN and NRG. In Group Omega, Leviatán had already qualified as the top seed. 100 Thieves, LOUD, and EG were all in contention for the final two spots, but only the former two had games this week. Both teams won their respective games and qualified for playoffs. As for seeding, both KRÜ and Leviatán topped their groups after losing one game apiece, netting them a bye in the playoffs and ensuring they will only need one playoff match win to qualify for Masters Shanghai. They also were awarded an additional championship point. While Americas had their top teams and close contenders, unfortunately neither FURIA nor MIBR were able to win a single series in the split. Meta report In terms of agent picks, Viper dominated with a >90% winrate on five out of the seven maps. Raze was also the duelist of choice on all maps except Icebox, Breeze, and Ascent. Gekko continued thriving as the initiator with the most impact, a major change from the Skye-dominant meta of last year. Finally, both Killjoy and Cypher continue to top the sentinels rankings aside from on Bind and Split, where Viper often replaces them as a pseudo-sentinel. Outstanding players Aspas was the most consistent player in terms of getting frags for his team, rocking an ACS of at least 250 in every match of the split. Cloud9's OXY performed similarly with a minimum ACS of 240, and often averaging more than 320. While both Aspas and OXY were the star duelists of their teams with crucial entries, KRÜ's Keznit dominated in terms of first kills for his team, and the rest of his team were consistently up there with him on the scoreboard. Stage 1 regular season results Group Alpha KRÜ Esports (5-1, +43 round differential.)

The two teams that made it to Masters Madrid are returning to international play, while T1 bounced back from a poor regional stage to make it to their first international tournament of 2024. DRX just miss out on Shanghai after going undefeated in Stage 1 One of the biggest surprises out of the VCT Pacific 2024 Stage 1 playoffs is DRX . They entered the playoffs undefeated since bringing in rookie flex player Kang \" BeYN \" Ha-bin (강하빈) , and only needed to win one game to make it to their first international tournament of the year. They even had two chances, as their strong regular season play gave them a bye to the double-elimination section. Alas, they ended up facing the two teams that went to Madrid back-to-back, and lost 2-1 both times. Both series were back and forth, but it wasn't as close as the scoreline suggested. DRX had specific maps where they looked better than their opponents, but when they lost, it was relatively one-sided. Their Ascent against Paper Rex was strong , just like their Bind against Gen.G. But they only managed to get double digits once in the other four maps. DRX lost 13-6 twice against Paper Rex, and then lost to a Gen.G team who refused to get eliminated after getting sent to the lower bracket by T1. DRX received six circuit points for their Stage 1 performance. T1 go from 2-4 to Shanghai Out of all the teams that qualified for this playoff tournament, T1 looked to be the weakest due to their regular season performance. DetonatioN FocusMe beat them, something no other Pacific team can say so far in franchising. Also, T1 were the only team with a negative win differential to make it to the playoffs in Pacific. However, as fans remember from the Pacific Kickoff tournament, the potential of the T1 roster remained high. In these playoffs, fans finally were able to see what T1 could do if Paper Rex couldn't eliminate them. After a clean 2-0 win over Team Secret , T1 faced off against Gen.G and squeaked out a 2-1 series win. While Kevin \" xccurate \" Susanto and Ham \" iZu \" Woo-ju (함우주) led the way against Team Secret, Ha \" Sayaplayer \" Jeong-woo (하정우) and Lee \" carpe \" Jae-hyeok (이재혁) stepped up against tougher opponents to get them to Shanghai. Looking at the series stats, it looked like Gen.G had the better fragging, but Carpe had a high KAST at 81% and the least deaths in the game at 39. That alone showed his patience and teamwork across that series. Plus, Sayaplayer had a great third map of the series with 25 kills and 228 ADR. T1 then lost to Paper Rex 2-0 in the upper final, but they can start getting ready for international play. Paper Rex and Gen.G return to international play The Pacific teams that made Madrid are returning to try and contend for the title in Shanghai. Paper Rex look reinvigorated with Wang \" Jinggg \" Jing Jie returning to the lineup, back at the same level as the team that made the Champions finals back in 2023. Beating T1 to get their spot in the regional finals, they have another chance to try and get that first seed for Pacific that they missed out on at Kickoff. As for Gen.G, while they don't look like the same team that made the Madrid finals, they still have the chance to try and win the title they missed out on. In that winner-takes-all lower bracket win against DRX, it was Kim \" t3xture \" Na-ra (김나라) that seized the opportunity. For the second time this year, Gen.G eliminated DRX from an international tournament, as t3xture dropped 55 kills and a remarkable 16 first kills to only six first deaths across the series. Gen.G will face off in the lower finals against T1 on May 11. Paper Rex will then face the winner of that matchup in the Stage 1 playoff grand finals to see how the seeding falls for the Pacific region heading into Masters Shanghai."

    "cleaned_content": "The VCT EMEA Stage 1 regular season has concluded, with six teams advancing to playoffs . The split came down to the wire, as the final match, BBL Esports vs. FUT Esports , had both seeding and playoff implications for five different teams. Karmine Corp , Team Heretics , Natus Vincere , and FNATIC return to the playoffs, while FUT Esports and Team Liquid round out the top six. On the other hand, map differential kept both BBL Esports and Team Vitality out of Shanghai contention, joining the Group Omega teams with losing records: Gentle Mates , GIANTX , KOI . Overall, FUT and NAVI were the best performers throughout Stage 1. Both teams only lost one series, and were joint-first place, alongside Karmine Corp, in terms of map wins. FUT stood out over NAVI, as they won three matches without dropping a map, granting them the top seed for Group Omega. The Key Moments Unlike other regions, EMEA was the only league to begin their final week with no team confirmed for playoffs. Mathematically, a total of nine teams were able to advance to playoffs, and it wasn't until the end of Day 2 that NAVI, Karmine Corp, and FNATIC qualified, despite the latter two teams ending the group stage on a loss. On Day 3, Team Liquid's 2-0 victory over Gentle Mates kept their hopes alive, and their first map win guaranteed both Heretics and FUT Esports making the top six. The final match, FUT vs BBL, would determine which of BBL and Team Liquid would advance to playoffs. Prior to the match, BBL and Team Liquid were, respectively, the top and bottom team in Group Alpha in terms of record. Additionally, the outcome of the match determined the top seed from each group, granting them an additional championship point and a bye, meaning they would only need one match win to qualify to Shanghai. In the end, FUT's 2-0 victory helped Team Liquid overtake BBL based on map differential and sent BBL down to fourth place. In terms of seeding, the match meant FUT and Karmine Corp entered playoffs as the top teams from their respective groups. Interestingly, neither of the playoff teams from Group Alpha were able to take a win against the top three Group Omega teams. In contrast, Team Vitality and BBL Esports were the only teams to win against the Group Omega playoffs teams, with two victories apiece.

Both T1 and Paper Rex move on to fight in a double elimination bracket against Gen.G and DRX respectively, with only one team out of the four missing out on Masters Shanghai. T1 sends Team Secret home T1 picked Lotus, Team Secret picked Sunset, leaving Breeze as the potential decider. Lotus had four mirror picks, with the only difference being Chamber for T1 and Killjoy for Team Secret. Starting on the defense side, T1 took an early lead despite losing the first pistol round. A second half eco win almost turned the tides for Team Secret, but Ham \" iZu \" Woo-ju (함우주) took T1 to a 13-7 map win. For Sunset, Team Secret decided to run Breach and Sova, while T1 ran Gekko and KAY/O. Breach has his uses on the thin hallways of Sunset, while Gekko allows for some quick B takes and easy plants. It began with Team Secret taking the lead on defense, looking confident on their map pick. The pressure they would apply just before enemy executes or just after plants seemed impossible for T1 to counter. Team Secret headed into the half up 9-3, but T1's attack side brought the map back. The map ended 13-11 for T1, winning the series 2-0. Ha \" Sayaplayer \" Jeong-woo (하정우) proved crucial on defense, but Kevin \" xccurate \" Susanto was the MVP for map two and the series as a whole. Playing both Chamber and Cypher, xccurate ended with 41 kills and a 163 ADR, second in the lobby behind Team Secret duelist Jeremy \" Jremy \" Cabrera . With this loss, Team Secret are eliminated from the tournament and Masters Shanghai contention. T1 will face Gen.G in the upper semifinals on May 4. Paper Rex keep themselves alive with win over Talon Esports For the second elimination map of the day, Talon picked Lotus, Paper Rex picked Bind, leaving Sunset as the potential decider. Paper Rex ran their traditional double duelist, while Talon went with a double smoke composition. Paper Rex got off to a hot start and never slowed down, winning Lotus in a perfect 13-0 . Due to this win, stats were outstanding from Paper Rex, including two players with a 100% KAST and Ilya \" something \" Petrov dropping both 248 ADR and seven first kills to only one first death. Credit to Talon, they somehow turned a 13-0 loss on their map pick into a strong Bind performance. It wasn't 13-0, but a 9-3 half turned into a 13-7 map win. Unlike the previous map, something wasn't the star, it was Joseph \" ban \" Seungmin Oh from Talon Esports, who headed into the half with a 13/6/6 stat line. After losing the pistol round in the second half, they closed out the map and took the series to Sunset. Similarly to Lotus, Paper Rex started off hot with a 10-2 first half. Their defense with both Breach and Gekko stifled everything Talon tried to throw at them, preventing Peter \" Governor \" No on the Neon from doing much. Thanks to Neon getting more value on their defense, Talon did bring the map back to a respectful scoreline. Yet, the lead proved too significant, and Paper Rex won 13-9 and eliminated Talon Esports from Masters Shanghai . Paper Rex will face off against DRX in the upper semifinals on May 4."

    "url": "https://www.vlr.gg/340763/patch-8-08-includes-cypher-viper-nerfs",
    "cleaned_content": "Patch 8.08 for Valorant has both Cypher and Viper receiving nerfs. Both Cypher's Tripwire and Spycam have been nerfed, while Viper now has only one Snake Bite and cannot move her Poison Cloud orb after the round starts. The full patch notes have been reproduced below. CHAMBER, CYPHER AND VIPER Chamber We've updated Chamber's voice lines and added interaction lines with Reyna, Astra, and Omen. Cypher Since his updates in 7.09, we've been excited to see Cypher solidify a stronger spot on the Sentinel roster, but feel it's pushed his stalling power further than we'd like for an Agent that specializes in global information. Additionally, we've seen play patterns around Spycam (E) that lack counterplay for the enemy team. Updates to Cypher's Trapwire (C) gives enemies more time to deal with it after it has been triggered while the reduction in slow duration provides those caught a slightly better chance to use movement to avoid death. Trapwire (C) Re-arm time increased 1 >>> 2s Slow on Trapwire reduced 2 >>> 1.25s We've seen it become common for Cyphers' to hide Spycams (E) in the playspace and continually watch enemies without them knowing. We've added an audio telegraph for enemies who are being watched to provide those who are quietly moving a cue that they are being watched. Spycam (E) Enemies now hear looping audio when they are actively being watched by Cypher from within the Spycam (E). Viper As you have continued to improve leveraging Viper's strengths, she's grown into a dominant meta force and constant presence in pro play. With this update, we hope to solidify clear weaknesses that Viper has compared to her peers while still maintaining her unique identity as a Controller / Sentinel hybrid. You should feel that Viper has to commit to her positions and manage shorter individual up times per smoke use with her unique ability to control her smoke over time. Reduction in total smoke uptime coupled with reduction in the cooldown of reactivating aim to reduce her total stalling uptime and push you to better manage your fuel. Increasing the minimum fuel to activate her smokes creates a larger window for enemies to attack when her fuel is fully drained. Poison Cloud (Q) only being retrievable in the Buy Phase pushes you to make sharper calls of where you'll place the ability each round and sharpen her identity of high influence in a highly committed area. Reducing Snake Bite (C) to a single charge reduces how often Viper can use the ability to fill the gaps while her smokes are down and increases the importance of fuel management. The increase in duration ensures that a single Snake Bite (C) charge is lethal to all enemies that are in the acid for its full duration. We messaged this out on socials but want to call out again that in 7.09 we unintentionally shipped some number changes to Viper's fuel. For full visibility, you'll see three numbers in some of the changes listed below: First will be before 7.09, second after 7.09, and the final is the update for 8.08. Toxic Screen (E) and Poison Cloud (Q) Max uptime on each individual smoke source reduced 15 >>> 13.5 >>> 12s Minimum fuel needed to activate smoke increased 20% >>> 30% Cooldown on re-activating smokes after putting them down reduced 8 >>> 5.5 >>> 5s Poison Cloud (Q) Can now only be picked up during the Buy Phase Snake Bite (C) Charges reduced 2 >>> 1 Price increased 200 >>> 300 Duration increased 5.5 >>> 6.5s PREMIER UPDATES A new Stage of Premier starts! With this one, we're adding promotion. See your division's promotion requirements on the standings page. Meet those requirements to be placed at least one division higher in Stage E9A1. The Premier Score playoff qualification threshold is 600 for all divisions. BUG FIXES Agent Fixed issues related to inaccurate line-of-sight checks near certain abilities (e.g., Phoenix's Blaze (C)). This could manifest in flashes not working appropriately when the detonation was on the other side of a wall that was in the process of raising or lowering. This fix applies to Phoenix's Blaze (C), Neon's Fast Lane (C), Harbor's High Tide (E), and Viper's Toxic Screen (E) and Viper's Pit (X). Fixed an issue where AI-controlled abilities (e.g., Killjoy's Turret (E)) could detect you through Harbor's High Tide (E). Fixed Clove's icons being incorrect when Ruse (E) was equipped. Fixed a bug where Cypher's Trapwire (C) showed on the map even when disabled. Maps Fixed an exploit on Split that allowed Agents to stand on a sign on A Site. Gameplay Systems Fixed an issue where footsteps were not produced when in ADS and when running while slowed by Sage's Slow Orb (Q) ability. Premier Fixed a bug where practice matches did not lock your division in."

    "cleaned_content": "The VCT Pacific Stage 1 regular season is over, with playoffs on the horizon. Six teams are fighting for three Masters Shanghai slots. Gen.G , Paper Rex , and DRX continue to compete for international slots, while Team Secret , T1 , and TALON look to squeak their way to Shanghai. The two teams that proved themselves as the best Pacific Stage 1 regular season teams were DRX and Paper Rex. Both of them made roster changes since the Pacific Kickoff competition, and both improved significantly. Talon Esports used a relatively easy schedule to finish 4-1, only losing to Gen.G. As for the teams not making it to Shanghai, DetonatioN FocusMe got their first win across their near two years in franchising. BLEED got their first win of the year, and both Rex Regum Qeon and ZETA DIVISION didn't qualify due to the group format. Top matches from VCT 2024 Pacific Stage 1 Two matches stand out as the best of Pacific Stage 1 heading into the playoffs. To start, we have Gen.G versus DRX in week three . Considering how Gen.G swept DRX at the Pacific Kickoff earlier this year, this was a true test for this adapted DRX roster, and they stepped up to the challenge. It was a close affair, but the game started with DRX going up in the series on Bind. This is where the new pickup of Kang \" BeYN \" Ha-bin (강하빈) made his mark regionally, starting on Brimstone. He already played three games with DRX, defeating Team Secret, T1, and Global Esports, but this matchup against the Madrid finalists showed his skills. He played a solid role to help DRX get the series lead and ended with a strong 17/14/5 playing Sova on Ascent. But when he moved to Omen to mirror rookie sensation Kim \" Karon \" Won-tae (김원태) on Split, he was the one to lead the lobby. Finishing the series with a match-leading 52 kills, 83% KAST, and 149 ADR, BeYN re-established DRX as the best Korean team in Pacific. Now, the other key matchup had little impact on playoff qualification asides from giving T1 a scare, but was a great match to watch nonetheless. DFM got their first win as the underdog against T1 , who looked like a strong regional team coming out of Kickoff. DFM took map one of Ascent thanks to a near-flawless defense side with Ibuki \" Meiy \" Seki stepping up on Raze. The next map, Lotus, was a return to form for T1, but Sunset was another close map similar to Ascent. Similarly to that first map, the information Yusuke \" neth \" Matsuda got on Cypher led to some great mid-rounding and adaptations. On top of that, he top-fragged with 23 kills, leading to DFM's first win in their season-and-a-half in franchising. Stars of VCT 2024 Pacific Stage 1 For standout players from the Stage 1 regular season, there are two to mention off the bat: both Kim \" MaKo \" Myeong-gwan (김명관) and BeYN from DRX. Their flexibility was key to DRX's turnaround from Kickoff, and they both statistically led the region. MaKo was first in match rating at 1.28 , first in K:D at 1.47, and second in ADR with 156.7. As for BeYN, a rookie joining a team just before the regular season began, he was second in match rating at 1.20, second in K:D at 1.30, and led the region in KAST at 85%. Then again, it's hard not to have good stats when you went undefeated in the Stage 1 regular season. A different player who stood out to help squeak their team into the playoffs was Team Secret's Jeremy \" Jremy \" Cabrera . Team Secret finished 3-3, second in their group only behind Gen.G, and a lot of that success was thanks to Jremy's pure fragging ability. He finished the regular season second in ACS with 247.3 and led the region in first kills per round with 0.24. Stage 1 regular season results The top three teams from both groups qualified for the Stage 1 playoffs. Group Alpha Gen.G (3-3, +20) Team Secret (3-3, +18) T1 (2-4, -1) Global Esports (2-4, -22) BLEED (1-5, -50) Group Omega DRX (5-0, +51) Paper Rex (4-1, +33) TALON (4-1, +8) Rex Regum Qeon (3-2, -12) ZETA DIVISION (2-3, +3) DetonatioN FocusMe (1-4, -48) Prize Distribution Each team gets one circuit point per match win. 7th-8th = Rex Regum Qeon - 3 points 7th-8th = Global Esports - 2 points 9th-10th = ZETA DIVISION - 2 points 9th-10th = BLEED - 1 points 11th = DetonatioN FocusMe - 1 points VCT Pacific 2024 Stage 1 playoff preview The VCT Pacific 2024 Stage 1 playoffs start with a knockout round, then adapt to a double-elimination format after the first round, with the top three teams qualifying for Masters Shanghai. The knockout round consists of Team Secret versus T1, and Paper Rex versus Talon Esports. The losers are knocked out of the tournament and Masters Shanghai contention. The teams that get the bye to the upper semifinals are the group leaders, Gen.G and DRX, who both start in the double-elimination format. Gen.G will face the winner of Team Secret and T1, while DRX will face the winners of Paper Rex and Talon Esports. Then, the winners will move to the upper finals, guaranteeing their qualification to Masters Shanghai, while the losers will move to the lower round. In the end, the two teams that reach the grand final and the team that makes the lower final will all qualify for Masters Shanghai. The winner of the grand final gets three circuit points, but those are the only points offered in this tournament outside of points for every match win."

Karmine Corp have announced an affiliate partnership with French Challengers team, Zerance . The collaboration will allow both teams to closely work together in terms of content creation, as well as unlock the option for Karmine Corp to use two-way players. Karmine Corp is the third VCT organization to announce an affiliate partnership. The affiliate system means players can now be substitutes for a VCT team without spending the rest of the season on the bench. Players designated as two-way are able to play in both VCT matches with the main organization, as well as Challengers matches with the affiliate organization, as long as the player does not participate in more than 50% of the VCT team's matches in a given stage. Currently, Karmine Corp have not officially designated any two-way players. Prior to receiving Riot approval for the partnership, Karmine Corp and Zerance had chosen Yaroslav \" Jady \" Nikolaev and Lucas \" lux9 \" Danna as two-way players, as confirmed by Jady on vkontakte . As of the time of writing, neither organization has responded to requests for comment on the status of the players or any current two-way options. Zerance recently ended Challengers France with a 3-4 record and will next play the Promotion/Relegation tournament, Up and Down . Up until week five, the team was second place in the league."

    "cleaned_content": "The beginning of Episode 9 on June 25 will see the introduction of the new Invite Division to Premier. This tier of competition will feature top teams from the previous act's Contender Division, with the intention of providing a more streamlined path for Challengers qualification. Riot has also announced changes to promotion rules, which will be standardized throughout all divisions. Additionally, the format for the Contender Division and new Invite Division is slightly altered, in order to “foster a hyper-competitive environment”. Promotion Changes Starting from Episode 8, Act 3, teams will be promoted upon winning a playoff tournament. The new promotion rules are standardized across all divisions, adding consistency as teams climb up the ranks. When promoted, Team Owners or Captain can make roster changes as needed while keeping their promotion. Promotion guarantees advancement of at least one division, regardless of the amount of players replaced. Teams can also advance by more than one division, if they add players with significantly higher MMR than their team. The changes also mean that individual players that leave a promoted team to join another team do not carry over the promotion they earned with their initial team. Promotions are only applicable for the next stage. If a team does not participate in the next stage, they will be re-seeded the next time they play. The final change introduced in E8A3 will be a lower playoff qualification threshold. The Premier Score required to qualify to playoffs was previously 675, but will be 600 Premier Score going forward. This will allow more teams to participate in playoffs, as well as helping teams with enough points avoid scheduling conflicts or take a break from competition. A higher Premier Score will translate into a higher seed, so teams are still incentivized to participate as much as possible. Invite Division and Contender Changes The new Invite Division will allow top teams an opportunity to be promoted to Challengers. Image: Riot Games Episode 9, Act 1 will bring changes to the Contender Division format and a new division, the Invite Division. These changes are intended to increase the quality of competition and provide a better path for Challengers qualification across all regions. Any Contender team that wins the previous act's playoff tournament, as well as the top 32 teams from the Contender Division standings, will be promoted into the new Invite Division. Following playoffs, top teams from the Invite Division will be contacted by Riot with details on their opportunity at Challengers promotion. The Contender and Invite Divisions will have modified formats to increase competition. Every team must play in two scheduled events each week, and losses are now worth 0 points, down from 25 points per loss. Matchups will be decided based on team records, and rematch protection will be enabled. Playoffs qualification is based on standings at the end of weekly competition, instead of Premier Score. Finally, players will receive a new “Contender Eligible” designation, which allows them to participate in the Contender and Invite Divisions. This allows players that have participated in Elite 5 playoffs or are ranked Immortal 3 or higher to join teams in the Contender or Invite Divisions."

Initially entering the competitive scene back in 2021, jakee played for a handful of teams before briefly competing in the Collegiate scene with UST Esports . Following roster changes on Cloud9, jakee was picked up alongside Dylan \" runi \" Cade to assist in the team's journey through the 2023 Americas League . The team advanced to playoffs, and were a single series away from qualifying to Masters: Tokyo . Unfortunately, a three-map series against NRG denied the boys in blue a ticket to Japan, relegating them to the Americas LCQ . With one last chance at traveling to 2023 Champions , Cloud9 were only able to best Sentinels in the LCQ before falling to LEVIATÁN and KRÜ Esports , the eventual grand finalists of the event. Their 2023 run over, Cloud9 opted to participate in a multitude of OFF//SEASON events as they prepared for the 2024 season, securing two grand final appearances at the TEN Global Invitational and Red Bull HG #4 . As the Americas Kickoff rolled around, jakee and Cloud9 started off strong with a win over MIBR , but fell to NRG in the winner's match to meet their Brazilian adversaries in the deciding match. Unfortunately, the team was unable to pull through and were eliminated in two maps. Shortly after, jakee and fellow teammate Maxim \" wippie \" Shepelev were released ahead of Americas Stage 1 as Cloud9 welcomed back runi and new pickup Kaleb \" moose \" Jayne . jakee took to X and Twitch to explain that his motivation to compete had dwindled after the new roster changes and that the current state of esports led him to make the decision to step back. The young talent also communicated that he wished to focus more on relationships outside the game, which required him to step back and dedicate time to loved ones outside the server. “Playing a lot in general… it's taxing, I'll keep it real. As much as it was my dream to play video games… I would notice at the end of every week I'd be burnt out. In order to be in my best form, I would have three [caffeinated drinks] a day when I was playing pro.” Despite hinting at a potential return to the Collegiate scene, jakee expressed that he intends to put his life outside the game before everything, prioritizing relationships and income that aren't tied to the esports scene.

The series of events will be the first opportunity for EMEA Premier teams to qualify to Challengers. The promotion tournaments will take place between May 4 and May 7. Each Challengers region will have their respective promotion tournament, with a unique format depending on the region's VRC and tournament organizer. Broadly speaking, each promotion event will feature two relegated teams from Split 1, the top four teams from the region's Premier circuit, and, if applicable, teams from the region's VRC. The basic format will begin with a single elimination bracket featuring the Premier and VRC teams. The top two teams will then advance to a four team double elimination bracket, where they will play against the two relegated teams from Split 1. The top two teams from the final portion will earn a spot in the respective Challengers League for Split 2. The general structure for Promotion features two stages. Tournament organizers may modify as necessary. Image: Riot Games Northern Europe and Spain will have the top four teams from their VRC participating in the single elimination bracket. Portugal does not have a VRC, but they will hold an open qualifier instead. The top four teams from the qualifier will join the top four Premier teams in the single elimination stage. Like Portugal, neither MENA nor Turkey have a VRC. Turkey will instead have the two relegated teams from Split 1 participating against the top four Premier teams. The MENA Promotion format is unconfirmed, but they will likely have a similar system to Turkey. In Challengers East, the last place team from Split 1 will be relegated directly, with no opportunity of participating in Promotion. The eighth and ninth place teams from Split 1 will participate in the promotion tournament. The top team from East United Finals, trashcan , has qualified directly to Split 2, while the 2nd and 3rd place teams ( Szach Mat and Sila4i ) will advance to the promotion tournament alongside the Premier teams. DACH, France , and Italy will only feature the winner of their respective VRC, who are seeded into the double elimination stage. The top four Premier teams will still play in the single elimination portion of the event, with the winner being the fourth team in the double elimination bracket.

    "cleaned_content": "Karmine Corp assistant coach Ahmed \" ZE1SH \" El Sheikh has gone through a unique Valorant career trajectory, to put it mildly. Across 2023, he helped oversee one of the most entertainingly poor rosters in VCT history. Then, he had to play in that roster with near zero competitive Valorant experience as an emergency substitute. After all that, he returned in 2024 and took Karmine Corp to the top of EMEA. With an off-season of time and a new head coach to work alongside, he helped construct a new Karmine Corp for 2024. Only one player, Ryad \" sh1n \" Ensaad , remained from their previous roster. The rest were effectively rookies to top-tier play, with former FNATIC player Martin \" MAGNUM \" Penkov as the outlier. Somehow, the org went from the bottom of the league to eliminating Fnatic and winning the VCT 2024 EMEA Kickoff tournament. ZE1SH had to take the criticism and the pain from the 2023 season and use it for good. Being in the shoes of a player in 2023 helped him understand the pressure rookies have to go through to perform at the tier-one level. “I think when you play on big stages, you get knowledge, and you get a better understanding of what a player feels,” ZE1SH said. “Sometimes, coaches can think of the perspective of a player and criticize them, but can you bring it in a good and helpful way? Can you truly feel what the player feels at that moment?” ZE1SH and sh1n on stage at the KCX3 event. (Image via ZE1SH) After stepping into the roster in 2023 when Alexis \" Newzera \" Humbert left, ZE1SH was as eager as any rookie to prove himself. He self-admittedly knew that it was his brain that would lead his team to victory more than his aim, though he wasn't a slouch. Karmine Corp looked improved in 2023 when he joined the roster, despite not being able to make it through the gauntlet that was the VCT 2023 EMEA LCQ. “I was excited; I wanted to prove to the world that my vision and understanding of the game wasn't bad,” ZE1SH said. “Whether I trash-talked or jumped out of my seat in 2023, that was, and still is, how I naturally react to playing on stage to release the pressure out of my teammates and bring up our confidence. You can see it even though I am not playing anymore, I always have natural big-energy reactions on coach cam. I am just living the moment at 300%.” One of the highlights was soon after he joined the roster. Despite the team turmoil, KC faced off against KOI and got the team a win. He was quick to trash-talk them , but that was the way he released his stress in a more positive way for both him and his team's confidence. That same frame of mind was something he wanted the rookies joining the team in 2024 to learn or improve on. He worked in depth with each rookie on Karmine Corp, from the explosive Yoru play of Martin \" marteen \" Pátek to the surprising flexibility of Marshall \" N4RRATE \" Massey . The team's overall improvements took them to the EMEA Kickoff title, with all rookies having their key moments. ZE1SH lifting the VCT EMEA Kickoff trophy with Karmine Corp in 2024. (Image via ZE1SH) As for N4RRATE, the one non-European on the team, ZE1SH was quick to point him out as one of his crowning achievements as a coach. “I am really proud of all players on the team, but in N4RRATE's case, he's the one I worked the most with on KC,” ZE1SH said. “I work a lot with every player to help them with specifically micro-play and help correct their mistakes, but working with N4RRATE was more on macro and the overall vision of how he can impact the team with mid-round calling in his role. I worked a lot with him on that, and I think he's the player that I'm most proud of in my whole career. I always give the credit to the players though, I can try this with over a hundred players, and maybe two understand how to implement it and make it work. He's the one that implements it in his play style, while I am just a nerd who focuses on the theoretical side, so he deserves all the glory.” Considering N4RRATE entered KC as a tier-two duelist main from NA and exited Masters Madrid as one of the top 10 flex players in the world, it makes sense how proud ZE1SH is of him. Every player on KC has gone through their struggles in the past, especially since three of their starting five were on struggling rosters as recently as last year. We know the tale of shin as the sole bright spot in KC's 2023 year, but N4RRATE was also a star on the unsuccessful MAD Lions team. Include marteen, whose team couldn't even make it past the EMEA Ascension 2023 Play-ins, and you have some question marks. Thankfully for KC, their coaches Andrey \" ENGH \" Sholokhov and ZE1SH took the opportunity to study them and eventually scoop them up. “When you look into N4RRATE, or even marteen, who worked individually but not on their teams, you get them into the trial process and test them with the new team,” ZE1SH said. “Lots of teams just look at stats, and people don't look as much into teams that aren't working.” Karmine Corp entered Masters Madrid as the number one seed from EMEA. The region itself didn't do well at the tournament, but for a global debut, KC didn't fall on their face. They were eliminated in the Swiss stage of Masters Madrid, but were the only team who went home that early with a positive round differential at +3. A bittersweet feeling for the team, to say the least. “I would say that we weren't at our peak form, maybe at 50 or 60%,” ZE1SH said. “We played way better at Kickoff, but we also know it's the first international event for a lot of our players. Heading into Madrid, we were the youngest team in all of VCT. If we won some of those close matches, we could've built on it. They were good losses though; there is a lot we can learn from them.” KC will have to go back to their regional play and keep their pace up. They'll have to prove they're still better than some other big teams that were eliminated in surprise fashion at the EMEA Kickoff, most notably Fnatic and Natus Vincere . However, just knowing the level that they're at in comparison to the past year is outstanding. A highlight video of Sideshow reacting to Karmine Corp facing off against Team Heretics in 2023. The same organization that caster and analyst Sideshow was screaming at in both his Twitch streams and podcasts was now among the best teams in the world. He opted for the quote “from Melons to Madrid” when they eliminated Fnatic, and plenty of fans joined him from pointing and laughing at KC to screaming the word “blue” any time anyone asked what the color was. ZE1SH himself was aware of those fans, and those critics, and experienced their rise alongside them by leading the charge instead of bowing away from the pressure. “For those fans, thanks for supporting us, thanks for seeing the work we've done and forgiving me about last year,” ZE1SH said. “I've always been a really hard-working guy, and last year was tough for me because I tried everything and I gave it all to try to change our results. I didn't feel anything during the season; I was just focused on reversing our mistakes. After, when I rewatched everything and how bad we were, I felt awful that I couldn't have more impact earlier.” For ZE1SH, this year is different. “Now I can do this in my way, in my vision, and I am fully unlocked to give it all to players that are hungry.”"

In 2023, with G2's exclusion from the VCT partnerships, nukkye was picked up by Giants Gaming , now GIANTX. The team was unsuccessful at LOCK//IN, but showed a better performance in the EMEA League.

They had some modest results in 2021, reaching the top-eight in various tournaments, but did not make it further until the following year. He survived a roster rebuild in early 2022, as the org picked up players such as Spring , now duelist for Wolves Esports, and York , currently assistant coach for TEC. After the move, NTER reached the top-three in multiple FGC Invitationals, then the premier competition in China. They also won a number of weekly tournaments, defeating teams such as EDward Gaming and FunPlus Phoenix ZHUQUE . The team continued to find success early into 2023, taking series off of most top teams in the region, but began a steep decline by May of that year. Upon York's transition to a coaching role, NTER lost their series in the single-elimination portion of the Champions 2023 China Qualifer playoffs. After the tournament, Ninjas In Pyjamas bought out Eren and Spring, further weakening the squad. NTER were unable to advance past the opening round of all three China Evolution Series, failing to earn enough points to make Ascension.

In exchange, Trace transferred controller player Lo \" Flex1n \" Rui (罗瑞) to TYLOO. Flex1n was a part of the Trace core for two years, first joining the roster in September 2022 under the Totoro Gaming banner. The following year, upon advancing to the China Qualifier playoffs, Trace signed the full roster. The team was unable to reach the top-three and qualify to Champions, ending the tournament with losses to Bilibili Gaming and FunPlus Phoenix. Statistically, Flex1n was the highest rated controller player at the event with a 1.23 rating. As Trace continued to improve in the standings, he consistently contributed to the team in a more supportive role, maintaining a high APR throughout 2023. Since the China Qualifier, Trace has not placed outside of the top-four in any local event. Their best performance was the China Evolution Series Act 2, where they were able to take a series off of local powerhouse EDward Gaming to make the grand final. More recently, Trace finished in the top-four at Kickoff. They won their opening matchup against TYLOO, with both Flex1n and LuoK1ng finishing towards the top of the scoreboard for their teams. Trace advanced to the play-ins, defeating Bilibili and Titan Esports Club, but they were unable to move past EDward Gaming in the semifinal to qualify to Masters Madrid.

Among the acquisitions are Lo \" Flex1n \" Rui (罗瑞) , who was traded from Trace Esports in exchange for LuoK1ng and coach Yiyee , and Yang \" Eren \" Zhengwei (杨曾威) , previously on Ninjas In Pyjamas. Additionally, former Chao Hui EDward Gaming coach Deng \" shuaishuai \" Chuanyi (邓传义) joins as head coach, and Huang \" Sunshine \" Jinjie (黄进杰) , previously on Weibo Gaming , joins as assistant coach. Flex1n's arrival will reunite him with ICEKING, as the duo was previously a part of Totoro Gaming in 2023. They were signed by Trace Esports soon after, but ICEKING left in August to join TYLOO as part of their rebuild. Also joining is Eren, who last played for Ninjas In Pyjamas. He initially joined the project as a flex duelist player, but transitioned to an initiator role for Ascension. The team was unsuccessful initially, unable to qualify to any of the China Evolution Series main events across the year. Their performance was still enough to earn circuit points, which allowed them to make Ascension, the final event of the year. There, Ninjas In Pyjamas were able to survive the group stage, but they were eliminated after losses to Attacking Soul Esports, where now teammate hfmi0dzjc9z7 was playing at the time. In the lower bracket they lost 2-0 to eventual winners Dragon Ranger Gaming. During the tournament, Eren flexed to Deadlock for their Ascent composition, averaging 272 ACS on the agent. Trading Yiyee to Trace Esports left TYLOO without a coaching staff. As reinforcements, they picked up head coach shuaishuai and Sunshine as assistant coach. Previously a player, shuaishuai joined Chao Hui EDward Gaming in 2023 as their coach. Upon joining the new project, he helped the team qualify to Game Changers East Asia with a 13-2 map record. In the main event, the team went undefeated, qualifying to the Game Changers Championship after a 3-1 victory over ZETA Division. Unfortunately, losses to Shopify Rebellion and KRÜ Blaze ended their run, placing last in their first international event. Like shuaishuai, Sunshine also has a brief coaching career. He moved to the role in September, after being released from Gank Gaming upon d3ffo's arrival. Unlike shuaishuai, his new team, Weibo Gaming, was less successful, only able to qualify to the first Act of the China Evolution Series. After qualifying, the team was unable to win another series, losing both matches in the Act 1 main event and exiting in the first round of the Act 2 and Act 3 qualifiers. Weibo did earn enough points to qualify to Ascension, but they released two players in November and did not participate.

    "cleaned_content": "It's been a long time since Sentinels have graced the biggest stages in the world. Nearly three years after lifting the first international trophy in VCT history, they finally returned to lift a trophy once more. In one of the best finals the VCT has yet seen, SEN and Gen.G battled back and forth for five hours on five maps. Close fought affairs on Breeze, Bind, Split, and Ascent finally yielded to SEN's coronation on Icebox. The last tournament in which Lakia and solo faced SEN and TenZ was back during that first international event when the Koreans were just one more victim of one of the most dominant VCT runs of all time. This time, they had already surpassed that precedent by defeating SEN in the upper finals to become the first Korean squad to make the grand finals of an international event. Gen.G won the previous matchup in the playoffs off the back of six straight pistol wins and a dominant showing on both Split and Breeze. This time, it was a far more competitive affair as SEN battled tooth and nail for their revenge. When these teams faced off on Breeze in the upper finals, Gen.G absolutely ran away with their defensive half. To avoid immediately fighting an uphill battle, SEN chose to start on defense themselves. The grand finals started in dynamic fashion. SEN's IGL, johnqt , opened things up with a Tripwire kill, and both teams traded Shock Dart kills before Lakia won a clutch to give Gen.G their seventh straight pistol round against SEN. Gen.G's double dive with Jett and Yoru punched holes in SEN's defense. If SEN didn't aggress around the map to win fights, Gen.G pounced on the sites to set up advantageous post-plants that SEN couldn't uproot. Each time SEN tried to fight back into the half, Karon had an answer. He had multiple 3Ks that bailed out Gen.G from nearly unwinnable disadvantages. He wasn't even playing when SEN won an international event. The inexperienced controller player continued to make his case for rookie of the year, at least in the Pacific. His calm positioning tripped up SEN at every turn. Incredibly, Gen.G looked in control in the first half despite just one first kill and 11 first deaths. SEN only converted five rounds in the half, and they quickly tied the map off the back of their first pistol round win in eight tries. Unfortunately, their attack looked as lifeless as before. “In the second half we tried to be more defensive and less proactive,” Gen.G's coach, solo, said after the map. It worked. SEN were completely unable to execute onto either site, and they quickly lost 13-8. The kill distribution was relatively balanced across all 10 players, but Gen.G found all the kills that mattered. An 8-1 differential in 3Ks highlighted the massive gap in round winning plays. Despite a 2-0 record on Bind throughout the year, Gen.G had been avoiding it in Madrid. With their Lotus ban, they allowed it through as SEN's first pick. SEN looked much more comfortable on Bind to start the second map of the series. They got off to a fast start on their defense and kept Gen.G's economy on the ropes early on. However, once Gen.G's economy stabilized, their deliberately paced deathball attack started to run over SEN's sentinel-less composition. It took a huge Showstopper gamble for SEN to even salvage a tied half. What a read. A long stretch of miserable individual performances from Lakia defined Gen.G's early struggles in the Pacific Kickoff event. His recovery was a major factor in their Madrid run. He stood tall once again in the second-half pistol round, covering his teammate's spike defusal for a 4K in the waning seconds. Stepping up. Gen.G looked like they were going to run away with the map after winning three rounds in a row, but a massive eco round from SEN turned the tides. The NA squad struggled with slow defaults as Munchkin called consistent defensive rotations to deny the attackers any space. It took an up-tempo series of rounds for SEN to retake their lead. They sent zekken diving into the B site for entry kill after entry kill. They racked up five rounds in a row to take a 12-10 lead. At the end of regulation, SEN tried to slow things down again, and that nearly cost them dearly. They walked into reinforced defensive setups, and Gen.G forced overtime. SEN responded perfectly in the extra frame. A beautiful 3v5 clinched the game, outmaneuvering Gen.G's attempt to pinch the remaining players through the middle teleporter. Gen.G's star duelist, t3xture , was held in check all map. His struggles became a major factor in SEN again dominating the opening kill numbers. Ascent has long been a relatively static map with an extremely entrenched standard agent composition. Although teams like LOUD and PRX have been making major efforts to set new Ascent metas, this matchup represented a return to normalcy. Somewhat surprisingly, Gen.G chose to go to Ascent third rather than Icebox, a map which SEN had struggled on. SEN's coach, kaplan , said they were quite happy with the way the map ordering turned out after they saw it. SEN initially looked very comfortable on the favored side of the defensive bastion. They ran out to a dominant 5-2 lead. Unfortunately for them, Bind repeated itself as Gen.G fought back. It took back-to-back clutches from Lakia, but Gen.G tied the game. Missing multiple opportunities to put away rounds continued to define SEN's finals run. TenZ won a 1v2 clutch, but that was barely enough to salvage another deadlocked half. Another great moment from the hero of the first international stage. Swapped onto the attack, SEN again faltered at the starting gun. Gen.G ran out with another second half sprint to gain a commanding 10-6 lead. A last rally from SEN proved to be far too little far too late, and Gen.G took a 2-1 series lead with ease. On defense, Gen.G had a plethora of coordinated anchoring setups, and SEN rarely managed to bait out individual fights or mistakes before they dove into the meat grinder. Munchkin called a great game as well as leading his team with a 1.30 rating. In a game nearly devoid of big multikills, Gen.G's rapidly improving teamplay made the difference. Down 2-1, SEN found themselves quickly running out of room for error. However, they still had a chance. “My team has incredible hunger and grit. That's why we can get back up,” kaplan said. SEN gained a reputation as the most feared team in the world on Split, but their playoff run saw that reputation melt into a puddle. Gen.G stunned them 13-5 in the upper finals by keeping TenZ and zekken stuck at the bottom of the scoreboard. For the third straight map, SEN got an early lead. Their defense stonewalled Gen.G's double duelist dive in the opening rounds. An eco 3K from t3xture threatened to cause problems, but SEN dealt with it to help extend a 5-2 lead. The biggest difference from the first time these teams battled on Split was zekken. He rebounded from his previous rough showings to absolutely dominate, notching 21 kills in the first half alone. The hero this team needs. Down 8-4 at the half, Gen.G battled back valiantly. Meteor arrived with a 3K with his Blade Storm in an eco round, and he followed it up with a 4K to close the score to 10-8. SEN had a chance to reach map point, but Gen.G put together another eco round victory. The NA squad started to crack under the pressure as winnable rounds slipped away from them. zekken died to his own Paint Shells, and SEN gave up a 1v2 clutch to Lakia as Gen.G tried to mount the comeback. He thrives in these moments. Finally, SEN found their footing. TenZ won a clutch on an eco round, and they converted the map 13-10. Despite Gen.G's duelists showing up, no one could match zekken's blazing path of destruction. He finished with nearly twice as many kills as Munchkin and Lakia combined even though he slowed down significantly in the second half. “We just started to lose control as the small mistakes started to add up,” Munchkin said after the match. One of the longest and closest grand finals in VCT history ended on Icebox, the land of previous legendary final maps. For the fifth map out of five, SEN started on defense, and Gen.G started on the attack. Both teams brought their Gekko and KAY/O compositions, lacking any Sage or Harbor for spike control. The B site becomes incredibly difficult to plant on without any bullet sponge to provide cover. Gen.G did focus that side of the map in the opening rounds, but they only won a single full-buy round where they successfully got the spike planted without massive casualties beforehand. Lakia hit a 4K spraydown, and Zellsis tried to answer with a 4K of his own in the next round, but he was denied the ace clutch. Mowing them down. SEN's defense looked strong at both denying sites and retaking them, but a blown anti-eco again let Gen.G back into the map. With a dwindling number of rounds deciding elimination or a trophy, the individuals rose to the occasion. SEN won the critical final two rounds of the half to take a 7-5 lead, and a second half pistol win gave them a commanding advantage. As the anticipation in the building grew, SEN marched closer to the win. Their attack looked immaculate. Round after round fell into their grasp as every rotation, every execute, and every fight went their way. The raucous applause turned into roars that shook the stadium as SEN's coronation reached its peak. A 13-6 victory closed out a grand final, three years in the making. They rise once more. It was a brilliant overall showing from zekken who tied Demon1 for most kills in an international VCT series at 101. The still-teenaged superstar also finished with more than twice as many first kills as anyone else across the series. Sentinels have become just the second organization to hoist multiple international trophies behind FNATIC. Sacy and TenZ also joined an exclusive club of players to have multiple VCT titles under their belt. As to what pushed them over the line? “We wanted it more!” kaplan proclaimed. A heroic effort from Gen.G fell just short of the Pacific's first VCT tournament victory. They still left a sizable mark on Valorant's history with their incredible run. “A top-two finish was an amazing result and the players played extremely well,” solo said after the match. The steps they made also may prepare them for when they return. “I believe that I learned how to not crumble under pressure,” Karon said. The rest of the players agreed that they will have improvements as they continue into the 2024 season. SEN have a short turnaround before league play starts in two weeks.They will have plenty to celebrate as they rest and recuperate. No doubt, they will celebrate like kings. “The party is going to start when we take a shot out of that trophy,” Zellsis laughed."

    "cleaned_content": "Paper Rex defeated LOUD with an unexpected 2-0 scoreline in the Masters Madrid lower bracket semi-finals. PRX will now advance to the lower bracket finals, where they will battle against Sentinels for a chance to face off against Gen.G in the grand finals. Meanwhile, LOUD has been eliminated from the event with a fourth-place finish. Prior to the match, PRX player d4v41 was asked where he would rank PRX now that they've made it into the playoffs. “I think we have to give credit to ourselves. I think we're 10/10 now,” d4v41 said, “I'm pretty excited to play LOUD, and you know what L stands for? It means Less , so it means Less is coming for us again today.” The first map of the series went to Ascent, where both teams played their signature unorthodox compositions. something was on Gecko while ambitioN once again took to Phoenix. Ascent began with an explosive start. f0rsakeN nabbed a quick 4K on PRX's pistol round to secure his team the lead. But on their bonus round, qck stole away a 1v2 and diffused the spike with just 0.64 seconds on the clock. qck clutches 1v2 as Pheonix with 2 HP remaining. The next round saw something back on the Gecko attack-side Operator. Although he didn't get the most value out of the sniper rifle, it was still instrumental in clearing space for PRX and leading them into a 6-6 halftime. In the second half of the map, LOUD managed to briefly overtake the game 10-9 with a four-round win streak, but Paper Rex soon demanded retribution. The Pacific stars went on their own four-round win streak to secure themselves the first map of the series on LOUD's map pick. “I think LOUD is one of the most intelligent and consistent teams in the circuit. We don't even know what they're going to pick in the map veto, they can play almost all seven maps,” said PRX coach alecks after Ascent, “We just had to focus on ourselves this game. I think we haven't had the best run, so we really just wanted to get this—get ourselves more aligned if anything.” Sunset was another map where LOUD played Phoenix and PRX played Gecko. After LOUD won the pistol round, PRX committed to and won a thrifty retake. Then, in a series of events reminiscent of the earlier Sentinels-Gen.G game on Split, LOUD won their thrifty, and then PRX won another thrifty. But it was LOUD who ultimately won the final thrifty to secure themselves the lead 3-2 going into the Sunset's first gun round, after which Paper Rex called a timeout to stabilize themselves and their gameplay. In yet another thrifty, round seven saw Less win a 1v4 (with an Ace!) but lose the round after running out of time to plant the spike. Less gets the Ace but loses round to Paper Rex thrifty. But it was round 17 that sealed the nail in LOUD's coffin. After winning two consecutive rounds to close PRX's lead to a 9-7, LOUD finally had PRX on a half-buy. But if any lesson is to be taken from today's games, it's that you can never count a team out on a save. After LOUD successfully retook B site from Paper Rex, the round seemed secured with only mindfreak alive in B main. But then Less and qck peak through their own Viper orb only to be met with two shots in the head. Feeling the pressure, saadhak began diffusing while cauanzin moved forward to confront the enemy Viper. mindfreak peaked left and got the kill on Saadhak, then marked his 1v4 thrifty clutch with cauanzin's death. LOUD immediately called for a timeout, but they were hopeless in the face of PRX's relentless aggression. Two rounds later, f0rsakeN scored a ridiculous first blood on cauanzin all the way from Mid Bottom with the help of a Sage wall set up by d4v41. mindfreak clutches an impressive 1v4 in Paper Rex post-plant. Not to be outdone, something snagged himself a 3K on his now infamous attack-side Gecko Operator in the final round of the series to send LOUD home once and for all. “I mean, technically on Sunset we don't really have duelists, but man just loves to op, y'know?” d4v4i said in his post-match interview, “It doesn't matter what agent you put him on, he's just like, ‘Oh I'm gonna op, I'm gonna op, I'm gonna op.'” As for PRX's game plan going into the series, d4v41 referred back to LOUD player Less. “We matched up against LOUD…and I think our strat is probably just counter Less,” said d4v4i, “He gave us a lot of trouble last time, so yeah, as long as Less doesn't play well, I think we're good to go.” But d4v41 also had some parting words for PRX's next opponent Sentinels. “They've been playing very well,” he conceded, “But I think this time we have to prove that the PRX bundle is better than the Sentinels bundle.” Luckily for d4v41 and his teammates, they won't have to wait very long to duke it out with Sentinels over which team has the superior in-game merchandise. PRX will play against the tournament's last remaining Americas representative in just one day for a chance to clinch an all-Pacific grand final."

Gen.G will move on, competing in the first global finals of the 2024 season. Sentinels were sent to the lower bracket, one loss away from elimination. The map draft started with Sentinels picking Split and Gen.G picking Lotus, leaving Breeze as the decider. Due to the map pick system, analysts knew that one of Sunset or Split would go to Sentinels. After Gen.G banned Sunset, Sentinels got their best map in 2024 so far. While Gen.G chose double duelist with Meteor and t3xture on Jett and Raze, Sentinels ran double smokes and Cypher. The first pistol of the series went to Gen.G, but then the teams traded three straight thrifty rounds against each other. It took some hero moments from Munchkin to give Gen.G an early lead. Sentinels' strategies of flood retakes didn't seem to work on them, as Gen.G won too many duels both on entry and post-plant. The half ended 8-4, showcasing an impressive Gen.G attack half against one of the best Split teams in the world in Sentinels. Sentinels had to win the second pistol of Split to keep the game close, but Gen.G won the round off of t3xture being the most patient Raze player possible. t3xture patiently defeats Sentinels to win a pistol round. Gen.G reached double digits, up significantly at 10-4. They weren't able to convert their bonus, but Sentinels lost a key round to the clock soon after. Gen.G made Split look like their own map pick with how comfortable they were at mid-rounding, winning the map 13-5. The true standout was t3xture, who not only dropped 18 kills but led the lobby in first kills (4) and was the catalyst for multiple crucial round wins. For map two, Lotus, the teams ran mirror compositions with the Raze, Fade, and double smokes. An aggressive C Mound defensive rush from Gen.G led to their third pistol win of the series, but a force from Sentinels on their eco tied it up and helped propel them to an early lead. The map could've spiraled out of Gen.G's control, but a 1v2 from Meteor kept the game close. Meteor wins a tough 1v2 on Lotus. Sentinels ended the half up 7-5 thanks to key clutches, one from Sacy and another from zekken . Gen.G had the opportunity to tie the game up with a fourth consecutive pistol win, and Munchkin led his team with four kills to get it. For an attack-sided map, Gen.G struggled for the first time in the series. Zellsis looked to be an unkillable anchor, his Odin plays on C site winning multiple rounds single-handedly. Sentinels were immaculate on defense, winning Lotus 13-7. For the second map, zekken's Raze proved to be the difference, with 23 kills and six first kills. The first grand finalist would be decided by the winner of Breeze. Gen.G returned with the Yoru pick, as strong as they did against EDward Gaming earlier in the tournament. Gen.G won their fifth straight pistol in the series after a clutch shock dart from Lakia, and also converted their first bonus to go up 3-0. The key for Gen.G's success on Breeze were Meteor's Yoru value and Lakia hitting crucial shots. The Yoru ultimates seemed to secure at least one kill every round, while his decoys and flashes were perfect. Crucially, Lakia was outclassing Sacy on Sova, both in utility and in aim. Sentinels needed to take two timeouts on their attack to try and force back this game, but the half ended with them down 3-9. They took too long to start pushing down mid on their attack, and that only got them an extra round at the end. First, Sentinels would need to win their first pistol round of the series, but Gen.G got their sixth in a row off of Meteor's 3K. Down 3-11, Sentinels would need to do the impossible and replicate FNATIC 's comeback against LOUD from LOCK//IN 2023. Instead, t3xture laughed in their faces and dropped a 4K to end any hopes of a comeback. t3xture gets a 4K to seal the win over Sentinels. Gen.G won Breeze 13-3, stomping Sentinels down into the lower bracket. A standout among Gen.G, Lakia has reached new heights after a long-awaited return to global competition. His team is clearly near the top, but he knows they can be better and win a title. “If we clean up our mistakes, we have a good chance of winning it all,” Lakia said post-match. “We just have to keep the ball rolling.” Heading into the grand finals, Gen.G will face the winner of the lower bracket final. Either way, history will be made, as a Pacific or lower bracket team will win a title."

    "cleaned_content": "After a 2-0 victory, Gen.G have secured a top-three placement at Masters Madrid . Their opponents, Paper Rex , are now in the lower bracket, and can no longer lose a match if they wish to continue in the event. With this result Gen.G have extended their winstreak to eight series, as they have not lost a match since their first matchup against Paper Rex in Pacific Kickoff. They are also the third South Korean roster to reach the top three at an international event, and are one win away from being the first Korean representatives at an international grand final. Meanwhile, the Champions 2023 finalists maintain their hopes of winning their first title, but will need to win three matches in a row to do so. Paper Rex picked Split as the first map of the series, the only map they took from Gen.G in the Kickoff grand final. The two teams kept their new composition, opting for a mirror matchup. The double-duelist, double-controller with Omen was previously the only agent combination with which Gen.G had found success on the map. After losing the pistol round, Gen.G gained a comfortable lead. They picked apart Paper Rex's defense, shutting them out of the map for eight rounds in a row. It wasn't until round 11 that Paper Rex reappeared, an early mid push granting them their third round. The half ended 8-4 for the Korean squad, a favorable score going into defense. Gen.G remained confident throughout the series Lakia was pivotal for their offense. His Skye contributed with both assists and eliminations, as he reached halftime with a 92% KAST and 1.46 rating. Coming into the second half, Paper Rex once again opened with a pistol win. They were able to narrow the gap, eventually setting the score 7-9, but their weaker performance on rifle rounds continued. The following round Karon found a crucial double kill after an aggressive play. Gen.G was able to leverage that momentum to reach map point, and were able to win the map after a final consolation round for their opponents. “Paper Rex are infamous, but I feel like [our] players can match up to their firepower as well,” head coach solo said after the match. He told the team to “fight aggressive teams with aggressive attitude, don't be afraid, don't give them respect.” Lotus was the following map, selected by Gen.G. They won their first pistol of the match, and set themselves up for a dominant half after finding all five kills on their bonus round. Once more, Gen.G was superior during rifle rounds, and they won another five rounds in a row to secure the defense. Paper Rex were able to adapt, however, winning three rounds of their own and setting the score 8-4. Meteor finds a 3K to secure the thrifty Paper Rex extended the streak with another three rounds in the second half, but Gen.G answered back with an eco win on round 16. The Southeast Asian squad managed to draw the scoreline for the first time in the series at 9-9. A 1v1 clutch from Lakia helped secure their tenth round, and Gen.G went on to win the next four rounds to close out the map 13-9. Munchkin attributed their success on the map to their pre-game preparation. “We're familiar with going up against compositions with Cypher,” he said. “We had some miscommunication, but were able to set it straight.” He also confirmed they have not felt much pressure so far. “There's a little bit of pressure, but not enough to crack us.\""

Paper Rex will move on, competing in the playoff section of Masters Madrid, while Karmine Corp has been eliminated from the tournament. The map picks started with Paper Rex picking Bind and Karmine Corp picking Lotus, leaving Ascent as the decider. The series began on Bind, with Karmine Corp sticking to their double duelist comp with Yoru and Raze while Paper Rex returned with something on Reyna. Paper Rex got the first pistol thanks to crucial kills from Monyet , building off a great series against Team Heretics. A hilarious moment from d4v41 made a bonus conversion sweeter, shooting his teammates to make them nervous. The look from something was priceless, and the vibes were high after a strong start. Paper Rex's d4v41 does a bit of trolling. Monyet evolved from one of PRX's weaknesses early in Madrid to one of its strengths while facing elimination. It showed in an early ace, preventing Karmine Corp from fighting back. The takes of A main with Reyna and Raze looked unstoppable, allowing them to use that conditioning and take B with ease afterward. Monyet gets an early ace against Karmine Corp. KC scored their first round on an eco, but needed a run to keep the map within reach. Their attempt to match Paper Rex's quick executes and clever lurks only worked near the end of their defense, ending the half down 4-8. Despite their composition being stronger on the attack side, KC needed to start a comeback beginning with the second pistol. A four-man flank and some mistakes from Karmine Corp led to Paper Rex's second pistol win, but they force-bought guns to win on their eco round. It kept the map close, trading rounds after, remaining down four rounds at 10-6. Then, d4v41 sealed a close 1v1 win against N4RRATE , which soon led Paper Rex to map point. KC fought back to get double-digit rounds, but PRX took the map 13-10. Paper Rex was only one map win away from making it to playoffs and sending KC home. The trust between the Paper Rex players was fully on display, as head coach alecks revealed post-map. “The most important thing [with us] is trust,” alecks said. “We trust each other a lot, we know anyone can take over anytime they want.” Karmine Corp's head coach looked at Paper Rex as many fans do: one of the most entertaining teams to watch, and an opportunity to learn. “It's a pleasure to play against them,” ENGH said post-Bind, “we're learning a lot.” Paper Rex won their third pistol round win of the series to start Lotus. PRX quickly got the Operator in something's hands, even spending on their bonus round. PRX lost the round, so the Operator got cycled between teams, trading rounds back and forth. N4RRATE had a revenge 1v1 win against d4v41, and after a couple of clean retakes, KC took the lead. The lead grew, with Karmine Corp's comfort on Lotus evident in comparison to their Bind. KC ended the half up 8-4, a great result considering their loss in the pistol round. Paper Rex won their fourth straight to keep their hope of a sweep alive. For KC, a key strategy chance on their attack led to some flawless attack rounds. After securing the site, instead of planting and getting rushed by f0rsakeN or something, they patiently waited for Paper Rex's aggression to get easy kills. The lead built until the map was over, Karmine Corp winning 13-6 and tying the series. N4RRATE stepped up on Lotus, swapping onto Fade and getting 18 kills and a near-perfect 95% KAST. Ascent would decide who continued in Madrid and who set up a flight back home. Karmine Corp went with the triple initiator comp, while Paper Rex opted for Gekko and double smokes. KC won their first pistol round of the series and played off of some hero moments from marteen to get ahead. In a moment of need, Monyet used his ultimate while blinded to go high up in the air, surprising KC and getting a triple kill. Monyet launches high in the air, catching KC off guard. That proved to be a big moment to build momentum, as the half turned from one-sided to highly contested. Karmine Corp remained in the lead at 7-5 entering the half. After winning the second pistol on the map, KC was in prime position to close out the series. Thanks to some pristine Operator play from something, the game was tied 11-11. A clean site retake put PRX up at match point, but marteen blitzed his way to a 4K and overtime. A glass cannon Operator buy from something took KC off guard, and a solid hold from d4v41 and f0rsakeN won them the match. The experience of the Paper Rex team proved invaluable as the final map stretched on to OT. The one player who wasn't on that Champions 2023 finals team, Monyet, spoke to the benefits of playing on a team like Paper Rex heading into the playoffs. “You'll never know what comp we'll be using,” Monyet said post-match. “We have to take the games one by one.” Paper Rex will face off against Pacific rivals Gen.G in the playoff semi-finals, two match wins away from their first global title."

    "cleaned_content": "LOUD advance to Masters Madrid playoffs after a 2-0 against EDward Gaming . With only five round wins across the match, the loss is not only EDward Gaming's worst performance at an international event, but also their worst result since being formed. EDG are now eliminated from the tournament and are the second Chinese team LOUD have sent home. Now in the top four, LOUD will next play on March 21 and maintain an opportunity to become the second team to win two international VCT events. Icebox, EDG's map pick, kicked off the series. “When we saw they picked Icebox, we thought, ‘that's great',” saadhak said after the match. LOUD easily won their attacking pistol round, followed by a patient anti-eco win. EDG answered with a bonus win as expected, but the rest of the map was far from standard. Another two rounds followed for the Brazilian squad, forcing a timeout from their opponents. The pause did not pay off, as two rounds later AfteR saw the need to call their second timeout. LOUD's offense was suffocating, expertly taking advantage of weak anchoring and indecisive rotations to punish their opponents. Although they were reduced to one or two players across many rounds, their deaths were mostly consolation kills for EDG. saadhak barely breaks a sweat as he pushes aggressively By the end of the map, LOUD's confidence, and their rival's lack thereof, was clear. The way they were able to set up ambitioN 's Jett was significant, as he ended the first half with 14 eliminations and 4-1 in first-kills to first-deaths, compared to ZmjjKK 's 2 kills and 3 first-deaths. The second half was a formality. EDG won the pistol round but lost the next two rounds to an eco and 1v2 from tuyz . With that, Icebox ended 13-2 in favor of LOUD, who were now one map away from making playoffs. LOUD opted for Sunset as the second map of the series. EDward Gaming appeared to be back in form to start, an eco win helping them reach 2-1 after losing the pistol. The advantage was short-lived, however. LOUD were happy to allow the attackers to plant; a complete denial of their opponent's lurk left them free to set up retakes without issue. LOUD punished EDG's direct site pushes and lurks throughout the half It wasn't until the last round of the half that EDG found any success, punishing LOUD's early ultimates and mid push. The half ended 9-3, but the gap proved too large to overcome. LOUD took the second pistol round, and questionable economy management from EDG left them with essentially a half buy for round 3. They secured a 4v2, but LOUD were still able to win the round. The top China seed used their second timeout to no avail and the map ended 13-3. In-game leader saadhak commented on Quick's addition and his performance during the series. “I'm very proud of him,” saadhak said. “He only slept for two hours, he went to the hospital, but we told him to do his best,” he added. “Even at his worst, he is really good. I'm proud.”"

    "cleaned_content": "Paper Rex defeated Team Heretics 2-1 in the second elimination match of the fourth day of Masters Madrid . Paper Rex will now advance to round three of the swiss format, while Team Heretics has been eliminated from the tournament. “Yeah, I mean W-gaming is onto year three y'know, so we gotta figure something out for this year,” Paper Rex coach alecks said in his pre-match interview. Despite alecks' statement, Paper Rex won their map pick of Sunset 13-10 in typical Paper Rex fashion, scrappy with a few key individual plays. Following a 6-6 first half, Paper Rex came alive on their defense. On round 14, f0rsaken took first blood with a clean 3K on the Outlaw, and just three rounds later, mindfreak pulled off another impressive 3K with the Vandal. But the star of Sunset was Paper Rex's newest addition, Monyet . On round 20, Monyet clutched a 1v2 with the Sheriff, denying Heretics' comeback and forcing the Spanish team to save on a crucial 11-9 scoreline. This was the moment alecks chose to highlight going into map two. “I think [Sunset] was incredibly back and forth honestly. If I had to say one moment [when the tide turned], it would be when Monyet won his 1v1 with Sheriff against paTiTek,” alecks said. “I think it did wonders for his confidence and ours, so that's probably the most crucial point of the game.” On the other side, Heretics coach neilzinho gave some insights on what he'd like to see improved going into the following maps. “The reason we lost [Sunset] was because our fundamentals just went out the window, and if you do that against a team like Paper Rex, they're gonna pick you apart,” he said. “So that's why we lost our attack, and we're going to change that for Lotus.” Heretics went on to secure Lotus 13-10. MiniBoo led the charge with his signature Neon, putting on an impressive showing with his 291 ACS and 23/13/10 KDA. On round six, MiniBoo put an end to Paper Rex's 4-1 lead with his Neon ultimate, turning a 2v3 deficit into a 1v1 win against d4v41. In the next round, the other half of the brother duo also had his time in the spotlight. Boo showed off his patience and trigger discipline on A Rubble, where he waited for over a minute until he finally landed surprise kills on d4v41 and Monyet, securing Heretics the round. But it wasn't just these moments that got Heretics the map win. On Lotus, the team refused to let Paper Rex's relentless aggression affect their game plan. Even when the Pacific old guard threatened a comeback, Heretics held steady and relied on their teamwork to pull through. If Sunset and Lotus showed off each team's strengths, then decider map Split was an all-out brawl. In the first half, even the casters seemed convinced the series would go the way of Heretics. “Paper Rex are genuinely looking rattled here,” Sideshow commented at the beginning of the seventh round. Boo proceeded to complete his highlight reel with a solo 4K on B site while his teammates were still rotating. Following Boo's play, Paper Rex popped their second and final timeout of the map—and they wouldn't be in need of any more moving forward. Monyet clutched another 1v2 to start Paper Rex's dominance on Split, and as if a fire was lit under them by their coach, the team refused to drop another round to Heretics. With the exception of one hiccup in round 15, Paper Rex proceeded to roll over the Spanish representatives with their sheer firepower, ending the map and series 13-7. f0rsaken led the leaderboard with an impressive +10 differential on Raze, an agent he hadn't played all season long (he was previously on Yoru). PRX \"f0rsaken\" performing on stage After the match, alecks went on the desk to give some insight into Paper Rex's preparations for their new Split composition. “The tripe duelist was kinda overcooked, y'know?” alecks said, “[Monyet] said Split was the worst…so after that, we decided to put him on Omen and mindfreak had to sacrifice a little bit and go onto Viper which he'd never play before…and f0rsaken, we know he plays everything, so we just chucked him on Raze.” When asked about his agent flexibility in his own post-match interview, f0rsaken joked, “Maybe I'll play Deadlock or Iso next. Who knows?” f0rsaken went on to state that he wanted to face off against EDward Gaming for the rematch, but he won't be getting his wish. Instead, Paper Rex must take down their second European opponent Karmine Corp to qualify for playoffs in the third and final round of the swiss format."

    "cleaned_content": "After a disappointing early loss to Gen.G , LOUD bounced back against China's second seed. A relatively quick 2-0 sent them into the decider round of the Swiss stage, one win away from playoffs. LOUD completely dominated their map pick, converting Sunset 13-5 in a game that wasn't even as close as the final score suggested. FunPlus Phoenix finally put up a fight on Breeze, led by a standout 25 kill performance from Autumn , but in the end, LOUD's depth was too much to handle. A 13-11 score sent FPX packing. Both teams brought unconventional Phoenix compositions to Sunset. FPX compounded their uniqueness by adding in a Harbor and Chamber. Although their comp was serviceable in China, it yielded pitiful results in Madrid. A pair of clutches against weaker buys kept FPX from getting demolished immediately, but LOUD cleanly accelerated past them. LOUD applied a lot of aggressive defensive pressure around the extremities of the map and still had more useful utility for retakes when needed. LOUD held an 8-4 lead at the half and easily converted a 13-5 victory on their attack. Without a true sentinel, FPX were completely unable to stop LOUD from taking whatever map control they wanted. In addition to calling a nearly flawless game, saadhak closed Sunset with the most kills and fewest deaths in the server. Don't let this man have fun. Breeze ended up being much more of a contest. LOUD started on the attack, and launched 11 straight hits onto the A site. Unfortunately for the Brazilians, they routinely fell just short of cleanly getting into favorable post-plants. Despite winning just one true full buy round, LOUD managed to wrangle five rounds out of the half. One man show. Switched onto their defensive half, LOUD won their fourth straight pistol round and used that momentum to surge back into the lead. Autumn's Yoru found consistent high level value by diving around the map with his teleports. Several huge multikills from the Aussie kept the game competitive until the dying moments of regulation. It took three straight retakes from LOUD to survive the map 13-11. LOUD found more individual moments across the board in spite of ambitioN 's 11-20 scoreline with nine first deaths. After a winless showing in the Swiss stage, FPX have become the first team eliminated from the event. They will have to battle through Stage 1 in China for another chance at their first international VCT win. LOUD await a random draw for their final match of the Swiss stage. They will face one of EDG, KC, or the winner of PRX vs. TH."

    "cleaned_content": "Gen.G took down EDward Gaming in 2-1 fashion and have qualified for playoffs. Both teams had come into the winner's bracket after close 2-1 victories against LOUD and Paper Rex respectively. The map veto saw Gen. G choose Icebox, a map EDG had only played once this year and lost. Gen. G had a flawless record on the same, with five wins this year so far. EDG opted for Split, a map Gen. G had played twice in 2024 and had lost both games. EDG had won both times they played, including their victory against Paper Rex yesterday. The deciding map was Breeze, a map where EDG had a perfect win record this year, compared to Gen. G's 1-4 record on the same. EDG got off to a blistering start on Icebox with five rounds in a row as they started on attack. Both ZmjjKK and Nobody were able to consistently find kills while Haodong kept the pressure up with his Viper utility. EDG were able to capitalize on the lead to conclude the half 8-4. While Gen.G did find some success in the second half thanks to Meteor and a 1v3 clutch from Karon, it didn't avail much. Kangkang on the hunt. EDG continued their domination to take the map 13-8, with ZmjjKK leading the scoreboard with 320 ACS and six first kills. He also had an astounding +10 kill differential, with four of the EDG squad going positive in terms of K/D. On Split, Gen.G seemed to have recentered themselves from the loss and the whole team stepped up. They started on the attacking side a tad slowly, with the score at 3-1 in EDG's favor, but then found five rounds in a row, eventually concluding the half 7-5 in their favor. T3xture in his element. Gen.G continued their momentum, not letting a single round go on their defensive side, with six wins in a row to take their opponents map pick 13-5. EDG, despite ZmjjKK having the highest ACS on the server, could not win a single round in the second half. For Gen. G, both their duelists Meteor and t3xture found 22 kills apiece and 12 first kills between them. Another day, another clutch for Gen.G! EDG attributed the loss to their eagerness to close out the map. “Our mentality changed, and (we were) a little hurried to close out the map, that's all,” said Smoggy . As for T3xture, who found another ace on the map, he attributed his success so far as the sole player in Madrid with multiple aces to his teammates. “Please don't (keep an eye out for me), it would make my life easier,” he jokingly requested of the other teams. The series found its conclusion on Breeze where Gen. G were running a team comp they had recently changed and debuted against LOUD at Madrid. They lost against LOUD, but this time everything seemed to be going right for them. Gen.G got to an incredibly strong start on the attack, with EDG only able to win a single round on defense against Gen. G's bonus buy. Between them, Meteor and Lakia earned 27 kills in the first half alone and EDG looked hapless against the former's Yoru pick. LAN Lakia is so back. While EDG bounced back with five rounds in a row after the side swap, the damage had already been done and Gen. G would win the final two rounds necessary to win Breeze 13-6 and take the series 2-1. They attributed the loss to Gen.G maintaining their map two pace as well as their under-performance on Breeze. “I think it's our problem that we didn't do well in all aspects of the game,” said Smoggy. While Gen.G had run the same comp against LOUD and lost, they found victory today against EDG. Their coach said that LOUD were prepared to shut down a lot of their plays and that the Brazilians knew how to pivot around a non-Cypher composition. “Today, things went as we expected and planned,” solo said. “All five players on the team stepped up huge and I'm very grateful to and proud of my players.” Gen. G's win was a team effort, with only one of their players going negative in terms of K/D, compared to EDG where only ZmjjKK went positive. Meteor and T3xture between them had 20 first kills, just four less than all of EDG put together. Three of Gen.G's players also had more than 220 ACS, with relative newbie Karon being one of them while playing controller. All the other players who had crossed this threshold — ZmjjKK, Meteor, and Texture — played duelists for the most part. The winning moment. Gen. G will get to rest up a little before playoffs and are the second team after Sentinels to qualify. EDG is still in contention, and they will play an elimination game which will decide their fate."

    "cleaned_content": "Sentinels have beaten Team Heretics 2-1 in their debut match at VCT 2024 Masters Madrid. With this win, Sentinels are only one win off making the playoff stage of the event. Team Heretics have to win both their next two games to qualify to the playoff stage, as one loss will eliminate them from Masters Madrid. This was the duel between two popular organizations, from the Americas fan-favorite that is Sentinels to the local Spanish org Team Heretics. Both teams didn't see any global play in 2023, improving to make it to Madrid in 2024, and faced each other on Lotus first to see which one was better. The map picks started with Lotus from Sentinels and Sunset from Team Heretics, leaving Bind as the decider. Despite their 5-2 map record on Split, Sentinels chose Lotus instead and wasn't able to get Split as the deciding map. Team Heretics started on the attack side, running agents they had won plenty of games in EMEA on, with MiniBoo most notably back on his signature Neon. However, TenZ was the one to step up on his Omen, getting an ace in the opening pistol round. That moment could've set the tone for Sentinels' defense, but Heretics won their eco round afterward. The early rounds were chaotic, with the two teams one-upping each other with clever plays. The best example was round five, where MiniBoo charged into A site through Tree to flank into Rubble. Every time Sentinels tried to build their economy through ultimates or weapons, Heretics cleared them out. Heretics built their lead, ending the half up 8-4 off of a triple kill from paTiTek in his Vipers Pit – a good start for an attack sided map, let alone Sentinels' map pick. When the sides flipped, Sentinels won their second pistol, this time converting on their anti-eco and bonus to keep the game within reach. After tying the map 8-8, Sentinels maintained their momentum, spreading Heretics wide across the map and constantly pushing the weak sites. Heretics won their first defense round down 10-9, and had what looked like a clutch thrifty to change the flow of the game, until Zellsis won a 1v2 when paTiTek and RieNs lined up. That effectively ended the map 13-9, a crushing attack from Sentinels proving too much for Team Heretics to handle. While MiniBoo led the map with 25 kills, zekken had seven first kills. Five of those seven opening kills were on attack, which contributed to the near-flawless attack half. The next map in the series was Sunset, another map that both teams were successful on regionally. Heretics began their defense strong, winning pistol and converting their bonus. Sentinels seemed set planting on B site, but the retakes from Heretics were clean. MiniBoo kept rolling, securing a close round with a 3K to go up 4-0. It took until round seven for Sentinels to win their first attack round on Sunset. A thrifty from Sentinels afterward shifted the economy for Heretics, and they took advantage to get to the half down 8-4. Team Heretics got their second pistol win, immediately starting the second half off better than Lotus. Despite no bonus conversion, they took their lead and never looked back. Their executes of both sites were near perfect, as Boo and MiniBoo created free kills with their Omen blind and Neon stun combos. Combined with plenty of fakes towards mid that kept Sentinels on their toes, Heretics secured a 13-5 map win. The series came down to Bind, with Heretics running Yoru and Astra while Sentinels ran Skye and Gekko. Heretics won the first pistol, and converted off of some minor mistakes from Sentinels to take an early lead. Sentinels were taking too long to plant the spike, as Heretics would use utility and smart positioning to shut down any pressure the Americas team threw their way. Sentinels had to take a timeout down 1-6 on their attack side, changing the pace to claw back into the map. Some key fast round wins, a clutch from Zellsis , then a clean post-plant on B site led to a 6-6 half. A pistol win from Sentinels put them in their first lead of the map, and rounds were going back and forth as Sentinels kept their lead. Then, the Astra and Yoru combined their ultimates to strike, teleporting to a corner without the enemy hearing it. It came down to the wire, tied at 11-11. A teamkill Raze ultimate from zekken seemed to throw away a crucial round, but it was saved by Zellsis. Sentinels clutched the map 13-11, and the series 2-1. After the win, TenZ was highlighted as a player making his long awaited return to the global stage. He went with the Gekko instead of the Yoru on Bind, and it proved to make their Bind better in comparison to their regional play. “ kaplan asked me if I was ready to learn Gekko,” TenZ said on stage post-match, “and I said I'm down.” After the game, the draft was done for the rest of the swiss stage, leaving Sentinels facing another EMEA squad in Karmine Corp . TenZ didn't know what team he would face when he was interviewed, but he knew that there wasn't an easy path to the playoffs after his teams' victory. “All the teams put in a lot of hard work,” TenZ said. “It's going to be tough match no matter who we face [next].” Latter swiss stage matches drawn for Masters Madrid Post-match, the event drew the next matches for the swiss stage. The matches are: EDward Gaming (1-0) versus Gen.G (1-0) Sentinels (1-0) versus Karmine Corp (1-0) Team Heretics (0-1) versus Paper Rex (0-1) FunPlus Phoenix (0-1) versus LOUD (0-1) The winners of the top two matches will automatically qualify to playoffs. The winners of the bottom two matches will face the losers of the top two matches for the final two slots in the VCT 2024 Masters Madrid playoffs."

    "cleaned_content": "EDward Gaming overcame Paper Rex in three maps to make it the 1-0 pool of the swiss stage at Masters Madrid . The number one seed from China is now just one game away from the playoffs while PRX face elimination. The series began with a Sunset pick from Paper Rex. PRX have so far looked dominant on the map in 2024 after a 13-7 win over Gen.G at Kickoff . EDG's choice to start on the defense proved to be ill-fated as a pistol round win would provide a majority of the Chinese side's rounds for the entire half. PRX's no-duelist comp was dominant throughout the half. something 's attack Operator provided frequent first kills while the Pacific representatives made Sage look like a meta pick. Even the heroics were going the way of PRX after a 1v2 from Monyet in round 11 and pivotal multikills from mindfreak . EDG conceded the second pistol to go down 11-3 but were able to briefly bounce back into the game with a streak of five rounds. EDG were able to exploit the no-sentinel weakness in PRX's comp to find gaps in the defense and played out slower rounds to perfection to close the gap. Both timeouts were forced out of PRX coach alecks , with the second timeout at 11-8 proving to be the difference maker. The final two rounds were picked up by PRX with ease to close out the map 13-8 and lead the series 1-0. “We gave them too much respect,” said alecks inbetween maps. mindfreak frequently delivered PRX rounds with high impact multikills in crucial swing rounds and topped the server with 21 kills and 281 ACS. Monyet won a vital clutch in a late half swing round. The second map was Bind, EDG's map pick. An early lead off the back of an attack pistol from PRX was quickly diminished as EDG refused to concede a round after an initial 1-4 deficit. Back to back clutches from Haodong paved the way for seven straight rounds from EDG to end the half. Smoggy was 5-0 in first engagements in the first half while Haodong and CHICHOO continued to provide high-impact kills facilitated by ZmjjKK 's KAY/O utility. PRX picked up the defensive pistol after a f0rsakeN Frenzy 4K to collect both pistols on Bind. However, this advantage was nullified by a continued strong performance from EDG. Haodong's lurk timings were perfect throughout the attack as EDG exploited PRX's continued aggression. EDG often took advantage of PRX's pushes resulting in weaknesses being left elsewhere on the map. A crisp 2K from ZmjjKK down long gave the Chinese side enough of an economic advantage to hit map point at a 12-7 lead. EDG fumbled just two more rounds following a disjointed Brim ult play before taking the second map 13-9 to tie up the series at 1-1. CHICHOO excelled on Bind to top frag for his team, dropping 23 kills with 186 ADR. Despite nobody contributing just two kills on Bind, the rest of EDG stepped up to force a third map. Haodong brought the momentum for EDG. EDG carried over their momentum into the early rounds of Split and entirely neutralized the triple-duelist comp from PRX. A pistol round was followed up by a bonus win thanks to a nobody 3K with Smoggy cleaning up the leftovers in a 1v1 clutch. This short streak was broken up by an absurd play from f0rsaken. Left alone versus five, f0rsaken collected two quick openers with a Judge before handling the remaining three after picking up Haodong's Vandal to complete the 1v5 ace. Unfortunately for the APAC side, the play was just a minor footnote in a half that continued to be dominated by EDG. The weaknesses of PRX's comp were exploited heavily by EDG as running no initiator forced PRX to largely face clear angles into prepared EDG players. An occasional PRX hero round broke up the multitude of rounds collected by EDG as they cruised to an 8-4 first half. ZmjjKK looked unstoppable and ended the half with 20 kills on Raze. Paper Rex picked up the second pistol with a clinical A retake but could only trade rounds for the rest of the map. Continued hero plays from f0rsaken meant PRX could at the very least trade rounds, but a dominant first half meant EDG's lead held strong. A swing round at 10-8 came the way of EDG thanks to a read that exploited a weak A site. A lone d4v41 was unable to hold the line against the entire enemy team as China's number one seed easily won an anti-eco to pick up series point at 12-8. A final multikill from f0rsaken gave PRX their final round before EDG closed out the series with a slow A hit to take Split 13-9 and the series 2-1. ZmjjKK dropped a monstrous 30 kills in just 22 rounds with an even more impressive 245 ADR to bring his team across the finish line and into the 1-0 pool. Despite his poor performance on Bind, nobody bounced back on Split to finish with an equal 1.46 rating to ZmjjKK. f0rsaken's already got a clip-of-the-tournament contender. EDG have moved onto the 1-0 pool and will match up with another 1-0 team for a spot in the playoffs. Paper Rex are now one game from elimination as they sit in the 0-1 pool in the swiss stage.

    "cleaned_content": "Gen.G have defeated former Champions LOUD 2-1. They are now one match away from making playoffs and securing a top-four finish at their first-ever Masters event. LOUD, meanwhile, will need to avoid a loss to continue in the tournament. The Korean squad have now defeated three top Champions 2023 teams in a row. Their recent matches are victories against LOUD, Paper Rex, and DRX, who placed third, second, and top-six, respectively. The teams' next opponents will be determined tomorrow, as they will next play against a team with an equal record. Gen.G will face off against another team that won their opening match, while LOUD will be drawn against a team that lost their first series. LOUD picked Icebox to kick off the series. Starting on defense, LOUD took the pistol round after a B main backstab. A failed force buy from Gen.G harmed their economy, and LOUD went up 4-0. Gen.G finally answered back with a round 5 thrifty, using Stingers to break apart their opponents' setup. The attackers went on to win another four rounds in a row, and the half ended 6-6. Going into the second half, t3xture and Munchkin helped put their team in the lead with back-to-back triple kills and a 2v2 bonus round. LOUD were able to keep the score close, but Gen.G eventually reached map point. It took a 4K from Less to force a timeout from the defending team. Karon closes out Icebox with a 1v2 Unfortunately for the Brazilian squad, Gen.G's weak economy was enough to avoid overtime. Munchkin pushed into LOUD as they set up for an A take, killing 2 players. LOUD were able to plant and bring their rivals down to one player, but Karon cleaned up, sticking the defuse to win 13-11. A key player to their victory, t3xture finished the match with a 1.33 rating. Karon was just as valuable, winning two clutches for his team and contributing 19 eliminations throughout the match. The series continued on Breeze, Gen.G's map pick. LOUD gained an early lead, with little resistance from the Korean roster. Karon contributed with a round win, and Munchkin kept LOUD's economy in check with a number of kills and a 1v2, but the half still ended 9-3. Compared to Icebox, ambitioN 's performance was night-and-day. He matched his eliminations just in the first half of Breeze, and found four first eliminations, one more than his previous map total. LOUD further extended their lead in the second half, taking the pistol round. Gen.G were not out of the match, winning the eco round and setting up t3xture for an ace against LOUD's own low buy. They kept up the pace the following round, catching the A defense off-guard with three early kills. LOUD punish an indecisive Gen.G, but the round is still close Gen.G continued to tally up rounds, but LOUD was able to keep them from doing too much damage, securing map point by round 18. A hectic final round would eventually end the map 13-8 and tie the series. Left as the decider, Ascent would close out the second match of the day. What appeared to be a back-and-forth start ended up with Gen.G running away with the half. LOUD put up a good effort initially, but Gen.G were able to overwhelm the defense and punish their mistakes. Gen.G rookie Karon was the best performer on their attack. He ended the half with a 20-5 KD, a 2.01 rating, and 413 ACS. He also won two clutches, and alongside t3xture helped win five of the seven opening duels the duo participated in. t3xture stops LOUD in their tracks Coming into the next half LOUD won the pistol and anti-eco, the last rounds they would take for the remainder of the match. Gen.G picked up where they left off on rifle rounds, winning the next two rounds and forcing a timeout from LOUD. Meteor helped secure their twelfth win of the map, and a puzzling A hit closed out Ascent 13-5. “I wasn't playing when [LOUD] won Champs,” Karon said prior to the match. His mindset translated to the server. “It's important to be confident against LOUD,” he said."

    "cleaned_content": "The first Masters event of 2024 kicked off with a battle between reigning EMEA champions Karmine Corp and Chinese underdogs FunPlus Phoenix , with the former taking the first win of the Swiss stage in 2-0 fashion. A convincing streak on Icebox was only temporarily halted by the Corp's adversaries before the diverse lineup closed out the map 13-8. Although FPX were momentarily able to stem the bleeding on Lotus with a dominant lead, KC bounced back in the second half to finish 13-10. Karmine Corp will now play one of the three other winners to be unveiled over the course of the next three matches. FPX will fight to avoid elimination against one of the other defeated teams. Madrid's stage hosted two teams hungry to prove their worth in front of the Spanish crowd, one after besting fan-favorites Team Heretics in the EMEA Kickoff grand finals, while the other bowed out at second to EDward Gaming in the Chinese Regional. Eager to take the lead on the road to playoffs, KC and FPX entered the server with a fury. The first map was Icebox, selected by the Chinese representatives. Karmine Corp opted to start on defense, which seemed like the right choice after they denied bomb plant after bomb plant to secure a 7-0 lead while simultaneously draining both of coach NaThanD 's timeouts. Despite this setback, FPX bounced back off of coordinated site hits and matched each round KC had picked up to tie the score 7-7 after their first successful pistol. Unfortunately, both N4RRATE and marteen once again stole the spotlight in the second half and helped build momentum for their team. The youngsters shared 22 kills between each other in the second half as they snowballed their way to victory 13-8. Despite accumulating a rating of 1.39 and ACS of 318, Life could only do so much on Reyna as the rest of his team could not keep up. I sure hope he doesn't ace the next round or anything… Back in good spirits, KC entered their map pick of Lotus on defense. Ironically, it was their opponents who took the lead this time around, as ENGH was forced to call a timeout only six rounds in after a 5-1 scoreline favored FPX. Fakes and team fights called by BerLIN – who finished his attacking half with a 1.32 rating on Omen – set up a comfortable 8-4 lead for his team as the sides were swapped. Unfortunately for FPX, the French fans erupted in cheers as Karmine Corp dragged themselves back into the half. N4RRATE once again came alive in the second half, this time with a rating of 1.89 accompanied by a monstrous 415 ACS on Fade, the highest in the lobby. When they were unable to retake and play together, FPX simply fell apart as KC snatched up any opportunity for an early pick and free space on the three-site map. BerLIN had gone particularly quiet on defense, only securing two kills while ceding three first deaths off of isolated plays. Last year his team was relegated out of Challengers. Now, he's farming at Masters. Eventually, FPX were only able to claim two more rounds before Karmine Corp continued their dominance outside of their regional league and closed out Lotus 13-10. Each player stepped up individually, and with a solid lead secured the team looks to meet another round one winner for a favorable playoffs seed. The final match of the day will pit Gen.G and LOUD against each other, the first time the two teams have met since the Brazilian fury eliminated South Korea's tigers at 2023's LOCK//IN . Day 1 Current Standings: Karmine Corp : 1-0 Gen.G : 0-0 LOUD : 0-0 FunPlus Phoenix : 0-1"

    "cleaned_content": "Out of all the teams to start the Valorant Champions Tour 2024 EMEA league, the one who had arguably the least amount of time to mix together was KOI . Not only did the team need to improve after a disappointing year in 2023, but the full five-man roster we saw play at the EMEA Kickoff weren't even practicing together until January, a month before the league started. Departures for the roster included koldamenta , trexx , and Wolfen , all late in the off-season. Only a month before the Kickoff began, the KOI roster added both grubinho and kamo to its lineup. Add onto that a respected tier two talent in ShadoW , and the team constructed an inexperienced but interesting team. While that has caused an understandable slow start, this year's roster is far more intriguing than KOI's veteran-heavy roster from the year prior. Two veterans from 2023 stuck around, but the addition of two Polish rookies turned what was a mix of European talent to a mainly eastern European roster. In fact, three of the four players on this new KOI are Polish, making this team the most Polish team in franchising so far. The only other team to achieve VCT success with multiple Polish players was Acend back in 2021, and KOI knows all about it, considering they kept one of those champions to help lead a new Polish core years later. One of their two vets, starxo, won Champions with Acend three years ago. A new, more Polish version of KOI While KOI did have starxo reunite with some familiar players in former teammate koldamenta and former rival sheydos, the team couldn't beat the opposition in 2023. This year, there's a different team dynamic, one created after starxo got involved with bringing some local talent to the team. “We trialed two different days with the two players, both before and after trexx left,” starxo said. “I proposed kamo as the main guy [for duelist], and everyone liked the idea. We didn't have a lot of choices aside from him, late in the off-season, but I still pushed for it.” KOI player starxo celebrating on stage at the VCT 2024 EMEA Kickoff. (Image via KOI) It was hard to shake off the sour taste that the last year had, with plenty of predictions leaning away from KOI due to those late off-season moves. The players themselves knew that the Kickoff event was more to get used to each other than it was to win it all. Alas, two matches against Team Liquid and the play-ins afterward showed both their struggles and their potential. “We're happy with the wins we got, and we all kinda fucked up as a team in play-ins afterward,” grubinho said. “After Kickoff, we are overall happy because we know what we can improve; we will work even harder and use the time off to train.” All three Polish players shared that same sentiment; that the Kickoff was a success in their eyes thanks to that revenge win over Team Liquid, but there was still a lot of work to do if they wanted to compete for that Champions trophy this year. The KOI rookies stepped up at the EMEA Kickoff The rookies might have felt nervous heading onto the stage in Berlin for the first time, fighting at a level they've always aspired to reach, but the vets on KOI were pleasantly surprised with how easily they handled the pressure, especially as the event went on. “I think they handled it better than everyone expected, even [sheydos and I],” starxo said. “I thought they would be more nervous, and it would lead to worse play or communication. But, they kept it cool, and even made us laugh as they told us to calm down. It shows they are mature enough to handle the pressure of official games, which is important as they gain experience.” The KOI team huddling together pre-match at the VCT 2024 EMEA Kickoff. (Image via KOI) Both the vets on the team, alongside the staff as a whole, tried to make the team environment feel comfortable. While it was easier for the Polish vet to assist and relate with the Polish rookies, it was sheydos that gave grubinho the advice he appreciated the most. “This is what sheydos told me before games: it's the same every time,” grubinho said. “The first round is nerves, but after a few rounds the momentum builds, and you don't feel like you're on stage. Every game starts with stress, but it always disappears after a few rounds.” As for kamo, he was excited to join KOI not only as a player finally reaching new heights, but also being able to play with professionals he took inspiration after growing up. “Both starxo and sheydos were on the team before I joined, and they were my idols when I was developing,” kamo said. “Then after picking up grubinho, someone I knew from Poland, the transition felt really good.” Take losses in stride, and maybe you can climb the EMEA ranks Considering how many teams in the EMEA league have mixed rosters of different nationalities, kamo was quick to point out how important it was for him to have two teammates he could instantly go to talk to, both about the game and about life around it. “When I first joined, I was focused on just improvement, which didn't help when I was struggling,” kamo said. “Having someone who can talk to you every day, who you can just hang out with, that was very important in the beginning.” Another angle of a KOI team huddle. (Image via KOI) Much like his other Polish rookie teammate, he shared the same positive outlook on the EMEA Kickoff, looking at the losses they had as learning opportunities. “We knew heading into the Kickoff that even losing wouldn't be bad because we can use the feeling and learn from it,” kamo said. “I was surprised with how well we did, and now we can use our losses to get better.” For kamo, he pointed that his game sense was one of his biggest improvements heading into the 2024 season. As for grubinho, he cleaned up his fundamentals. But for the veteran Polish player overseeing the group as the team IGL, he knew that his biggest improvement heading into an important year was his maturity. “I think I matured a lot,” starxo said. “The change from me in 2021 to now — I'm a completely different player, both inside and outside the game. I take criticism better, and my view of everything changed, from the small to the big. From the beginning, I knew I had to take the role of helping [grubinho and kamo], to make them feel welcome, and to stop them from overthinking about the game. If they weren't as open-minded towards me, it maybe could've been different, but I think I've given my best towards them. That has led to a happier environment overall, whether we all speak Polish or not.” KOI might not have the chance to play in front of Spanish fans in Madrid, but they will continue their VCT 2024 season in EMEA Stage 1, after Masters Madrid in early April."

    "cleaned_content": "Riot has released details regarding the regular season of VCT EMEA 2024. Two stages will run from April to July and determine the regional representatives at Masters Shanghai and Champions 2024. Championship Points Championship Points are awarded throughout the year for top performing teams. They will determine the fourth team that will represent each region at Champions 2024. In EMEA, Karmine Corp was the first team to receive Championship Points, earning three by winning Kickoff. Teams can continue earning points by winning Stage 1 and Stage 2 matches. The top team from each group will also receive an additional point each stage, since they play one less series than the rest of the playoffs teams. Finally, teams that win either of the League's stages or one of the two Masters events will receive three Championship points. Groups The 11 EMEA partnership teams will be split into two groups for the remainder of the year. Seeded based on their Kickoff performance, the groups will determine which matchups will take place in Stage 1 and Stage 2. Group Alpha: Karmine Corp FNATIC Team Vitality Team Liquid BBL Esports Group Omega: Team Heretics Natus Vincere KOI FUT Esports Gentle Mates GIANTX Stage 1: April 3 to May 12 The first part of the League will feature cross-group matchups , meaning teams from Group Alpha will exclusively play against all teams in Group Omega, and vice versa. All matches will be best-of-threes. Running from May 8 through May 12, playoffs will feature a modified double-elimination bracket, similar to last year's Last Chance Qualifier. The top three teams will qualify to Masters Shanghai. The best team of each group will receive a bye to the second round of the bracket. The next two teams from each group will play the opening series, with the winner advancing to the second round and the loser being eliminated from playoffs. From that point, a standard four team double-elimination bracket will be played. Stage 2: June 18 to July 19 The second stage will be played with a similar format to Stage 1, but with teams playing intra-group matchups instead. Playoffs will maintain the same modified double-elimination as Stage 1. On this occasion, teams will advance to playoffs based on overall performance, taking into consideration both Stage 1 and Stage 2 results. The top six teams of the season will advance, with byes granted to the best team of each group. The knockout stage will take place from July 15 to July 19. The top three teams of the event will qualify directly to Champions, seeded based on their placement. The fourth seed will be determined based on the remaining team with the most Championship points.

This pickup looks to replace the sixth man role on the team that pANcada fills, as the Brazilian looks to be on his way out to another VCT team. Previously, curry has competed in the Valorant scene, but is primarily known as a content creator for Cloud9 . He signed with them as a player back in early 2022, competing in the VCT for four months. Afterward, he was moved to the inactive roster, transitioning from a player to a content creator. He remained with the org for just over two years, streaming and reacting to VCT games alongside ranked play. In the 2023-24 offseason, curry filled in on the C9 roster, showing his capabilities against other VCT competition at the Red Bull Home Ground. The curry version of C9 almost beat FNATIC in the finals, losing to them in a close 3-2 series. With Masters Madrid approaching, curry confirmed that he will not be traveling with the team, but will be the substitute if needed."

Entering the 2024 season, pANcada looked to be part of Sentinels' future. Picking up Zellsis as a sixth man proved to be the key to Sentinels' success both in the off-season and the Americas Kickoff. He filled in for pANcada, and their victory in the first tournament of the season solidified their starting roster heading into Masters Madrid. With that outcome, Sentinels have allowed the Brazilian star and former world champion in 2022 to look for other teams to join in VCT. He could have faced contractual obligations that held him away from a quick move, similarly to Evil Geniuses ' players in the 2023 off-season, but Sentinels stated that pANcada has no buyout. This means that any team can get the player as long as they agree to a contract. Due to the lack of a buyout, pANcada is now a talented free agent, available as other VCT teams look to make changes before the regular season begins."

    "cleaned_content": "BLEED have announced the arrival of former DRX initiator, Kim \" Zest \" Ki-seok (김기석) , as well as Jorell \" Retla \" Teo , who was a part of the team in 2022. They are also parting ways with Javier \" Egoist \" Chua , just over five months since his arrival. Their in-game leader, Ngô \" crazyguy \" Công Anh , has been moved to the inactive roster. Since the announcement, Egoist has retired from esports. This move follows their early elimination from Pacific Kickoff. The first event of the year was a noticeable decline for the team that won Ascension. Considered favorites to make it out of Group A, they lost their opening series against T1, who were also favored to progress. Their elimination game was against Global Esports, but BLEED were unable to win the match, an unceremonious end to their run. Zest is best known for his time on one of the most storied cores in the game's history. First joining Vision Strikers in 2020, he was vital in helping them reach a 108 match streak without a single loss. They were less dominant outside of Asia, unable to make the top four in Masters Berlin and Champions 2021. The team was next picked up by DRX. They continued their local dominance and improved on their international performance, finishing the year with a top three placement at Champions 2022. They made top four the next event, LOCK//IN, but were unable to replicate the result later in the year. He was instrumental to DRX's performance throughout 2023, his Viper playing a crucial part in their playstyle and match wins. Despite this, Zest was released ahead of the 2024 season. He recently qualified to Challengers Korea with IAM, an orgless team. Also joining is sentinel player Retla. He was on an early Paper Rex roster alongside Egoist, where he remained until the org's eventual rebuild in 2021. The next year, he joined BLEED late into the season and was able to help the team reach top three in Challengers and the APAC LCQ. He stayed the rest of the year, winning a couple of non-VCT events, but was eventually replaced by nephh. After his release, he made Challengers 2023 with an orgless team, without finding much success in the circuit. The team again qualified to Challengers MY/SG 2024, but Retla has not played since making the main event. The roster only played eight official maps before making roster changes. Image: Riot Games Upon joining in late 2022, crazyguy led BLEED to win a handful of non-VCT events. They had only been able to win an event on one occasion in the past, and their best performance in Challengers was third place in APAC Challengers and LCQ. This result led to them being invited to Challengers 2023, where their changes continued bearing fruit. They won Split 1, losing only one series and a total of five maps. Split 2 was an improvement, as they were crowned without a loss and only dropped one map. The performance carried over to Ascension, making it out of groups with a 3-1 record and winning the grand final 3-0 against Scarz. The victory promoted them to the Pacific League for the next two years. Egoist had a less notable time with BLEED. He only joined the team in September 2023 to replace nephh, who needed to complete his military service. He played in two events with the team, Riot Games ONE and Pacific Kickoff. He was previously on Team SMG, one of the top Southeast Asian teams of 2021. Two years later, Egoist played for X10 Esports, but was unable to qualify to Ascension, losing both Challengers grand finals to BLEED. The following BLEED roster will debut in April: Nutchapon \" sScary \" Matarat Kim \" Zest \" Ki-seok (김기석) Jorell \" Retla \" Teo Derrick \" Deryeon \" Yee Jaccob \" yay \" Whiteaker Nikola \" LEGIJA \" Ninić (Head coach)"

After a year, G2 Esports picked him up as part of their transition to North America. G2 made a solid run in Split 1 after coming in third place but started to cool down in Split 2, missing out on Ascension following their top-six finish.

    "cleaned_content": "In a rematch from the group of death, Sentinels got their revenge on LOUD to take the first tournament of the year in the Americas. Two blowout map wins from SEN got them out to a massive early lead in the series, but LOUD battled back to set up an attempt at a reverse sweep. In the end, SEN finally stopped slipping and put the Brazilians away in dominant fashion on Lotus. LOUD continued to perma-ban Breeze, and despite Evil Geniuses showcasing counterplay to LOUD's flash rush Ascent composition, SEN still chose to take it off the board. LOUD returned the favor by picking into SEN's best map, Sunset. SEN had their way on their attack, getting the spike planted in every round. LOUD's lack of a sentinel or information agent led to them pushing and peeking aggressively on defense. When that aggression got them an early advantage, they were able to coordinate some successful retakes, but SEN easily converted a 5-1 lead into eight rounds at the half. SEN coordinated well across the series. The plethora of blinding abilities at LOUD's disposal allowed them to easily take map control or sites on their own attack, but SEN threw together extremely drilled utility combos to retake on the A site. Unable to turn the tides, LOUD fell 13-9. The duo of Sacy and TenZ combined for 21 more kills than deaths. saadhak 's Sova was often disconnected from his team, and he finished at the bottom of the scoreboard with an 0-4 opening duel record. Although SEN lost Split to LOUD the last time they played, an array of dominant wins during the tournament gave them the confidence to pick it again. That confidence was not misplaced, and SEN repeated their 13-3 scoreline that qualified them to Madrid over NRG . What a flick. The B site anchors from SEN got lonely as LOUD hit the A site for the first eight rounds to little avail. The site executes were disjointed, particularly from tuyz who often only supplied his teammates a single smoke for the hit while he lurked from the other side of the map. Down by two maps, LOUD went to Icebox to keep themselves in the series. They ran into a couple of pop flash traps from TenZ towards B, but for the first time in the series, they started to string together rounds. The Harbor Cove got them safe spike plants leading to an 8-4 halftime lead. Superb utility. On the other half, SEN's Gekko Wingman was far less effective at securing safe spike plants. However, LOUD were unable to stave off the site executes that SEN set up in the midround. Despite losing the pistol, a second round Stinger force-buy allowed SEN to storm back to take an 11-10 lead. With their backs against the wall, LOUD pulled off a miraculous eco win to tie the game, and they took the map 13-11. SEN looked shaky after throwing away their comeback on Icebox. LOUD brought another Phoenix flash rush composition to Bind, and they ran over SEN on their attack. SEN managed just two first bloods and three rounds defending against the onslaught. Good luck. After losing the pistol round, SEN once again went to their Stinger force-buy to try another comeback. Four rounds in a row gave them some hope, but LOUD still converted the map 13-8 after pulling off some strong retakes. In a series full of streaky maps, Lotus was no exception. LOUD's Phoenix composition again showed defensive weaknesses. SEN picked off aggressive players and blitzed the extremities of the map for six rounds in a row to start their attack. SEN extended their lead to 11-2 with the help of a second pistol win, and then it was LOUD's turn to try their hand at the Stinger force-buy. Although it succeeded, a few extra rounds were too little too late to prevent SEN from closing the series with a 13-4 victory. Slipping away from LOUD. Across the series, all three of TenZ, zekken , and johnqt finished with 14 more kills than deaths. Every single player in the server besides johnqt had a better kill differential on attack, as every map but Split became an attackers paradise. Both teams have qualified to Masters Madrid where they will represent the Americas at a tiny eight team event. The win got SEN three circuit points which will set them ahead massively if they fail to qualify directly to Champions at the end of the year. Banner image by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games"

    "cleaned_content": "LOUD and Sentinels became the final teams to qualify for Masters Madrid , taking down Evil Geniuses and NRG respectively to reach the VCT Americas Kickoff grand final. EG and NRG are both eliminated from the event. Sentinels and LOUD will play on Sunday in a Group B rematch for the Americas first seed at Madrid. LOUD eliminate Evil Geniuses to become first Americas team at Madrid The first matchup of the day saw a reunion between the two organizations in the Champions 2023 losers bracket matchup, albeit with five different players from that series. LOUD would open the first semifinal match by selecting Ascent, a map that they won fairly comfortably against both LEVIATÁN and Sentinels despite an off-meta composition. Evil Geniuses would not let the Brazilian squad have a good time on their attack, getting jawgemo 's Operator online and then complimenting it with two Odins. Those weapons, combined with Apoth 's oppressive Cypher utility and timely flanks, propelled EG out to a dominant 9-3 lead. Amidst the Odin warfare, the Operator still reigns supreme. Despite not looking perhaps as well-drilled on their attack, Evil Geniuses won a critical eco round to break the LOUD economy, which they used to seal a 13-7 victory on LOUD's map pick a round later. supamen and jawgemo were spectacular throughout the series. ambitioN struggled to have an impact on Phoenix, picking up just six kills. EG looked to secure their spot at Masters Madrid on their map pick of Icebox, bringing out the Deadlock selection for jawgemo once again. LOUD answered by imposing an attacking 6-1 lead as the entirety of the EG roster struggled besides jawgemo. Through eight rounds, jawgemo had 10 kills to match the rest of his team combined. After the rough start, Evil Geniuses managed to salvage a 8-4 half. Following a pistol loss, a force-buy win looked like it could give EG some momentum, but LOUD answered with their own eco to shut EG down. LOUD would eventually win with five retake rounds on their defensive side. Tuyz might be the best Harbor in the world. LOUD got the win with two pistols and by converting seven of their eight low-buy rounds. EG's performance was marred by whiffs and three different eight-kill performances on their zero-duelist composition. The series and first Madrid spot from Americas would be on the line in the final map of Sunset, where LOUD had never played previously in an official setting. The Brazilian players looked right at home however, as their individual skill shone at the beginning of Sunset, picking up multikill after multikill. Derrek faced a similar dilemma to jawgemo on Icebox, receiving little help to compliment his 15-kill attack half. A vintage Derrek performance wasn't enough to save EG. That trend continued into the second half, with EG mustering little resistance before being eliminated from Americas Kickoff by a 13-5 scoreline. A critical round 16 2v4 clutch from tuyz and Less after a Derrek 3K to open the round all but sealed the series. Evil Geniuses finished with a -40 kill differential in the final two maps. Most of the struggles came on their attack sides, with strong LOUD retakes overcoming the EG postplant setups. The controllers from LOUD were the stars, with tuyz and Less putting up world class numbers in the series. “We didn't have much to work with on Ascent,” cauanzin said post-match. “But on the final two maps we had some material to work with from EG's match with G2, and we prepared ourselves really well to take those maps.” Sentinels shock NRG in three map thriller The second semifinal matchup was a showdown between two of the most hyped Americas teams, as Sentinels and NRG would meet up to decide the final Masters Madrid team. The squads would open the series on Sunset, a map that both teams have had impressive performances on since its debut. A back-and-forth first half saw NRG take a 7-5 lead. NRG found timings and flanks constantly through the first half to cause chaos in the mid-round. A few strong retakes for NRG ended up as the difference along with a failed Sentinels force-buy after a pistol round loss. Another pistol win set up a path to victory for NRG in the second half, but Sentinels would block that route off the back of TenZ and zekken . NRG found only three first kills on their attack rounds. TenZ had a few blunders, but his play was a big factor for Sentinels' win. TenZ came up with a massive 4K on the final round of regulation to force overtime. The scrappiness of the map continued throughout overtime, with individual prowess showing up time and time again from both sides to keep the map in a deadlock. It was ultimately the incapability of NRG to find openings that would spell disaster for the Group A winners as Sentinels finished the thriller of a map with a 16-14 victory. A +8 first kill differential was the main takeaway from Sunset, 10 of them coming from zekken alone. Two 30 bombs from their star duelist and TenZ on the Omen were major components of the Sentinels victory. Just one map away from their first major tournament invite since Champions 2021, Sentinels started Ascent on the back foot. Despite a pistol round victory they faced a 8-4 deficit as Ethan was practically unkillable. \"Victor is just playing with them.\" Sentinels managed a few more rounds on attack but NRG was just too strong with their utility and reads on the map. Ethan ended the map with 27 kills and a 1.43 rating to lead his team in the penultimate map. The series and final spot at Madrid would be decided on Split. Sentinels were ready for the moment to begin with, with TenZ and zekken popping off to begin their defensive side with a dominating 5-0 lead. It was already downhill for NRG, but this just snowballed it even more. johnqt continued said dominance with multiple clutches to keep the successful retakes going for Sentinels. NRG had no answer for anything Sentinels were throwing at them, facing a 11-1 deficit and elimination from Kickoff. Even with a Marved pistol ace, nothing could stop Sentinels on Split as they clinched the victory. TenZ and zekken were the star duo throughout the series, both dropping 57 kills each. Sacy and Johnqt contributed timely multikills and clutches as needed throughout the series to be a strong fallback for Sentinels. Each player on Sentinels finished with a positive rating. For NRG, it was the opposite. Victor was the only player to be positive in K/D across the three maps. “We're a really close team,” Zellsis said post-match. “We all want to win so badly. I think the first match with LOUD was kind of a fluke, so I think we can pull out the best of five in the finals.”"

With this victory, they have claimed a top seed for Masters: Madrid , and earned 3 Championship points for Champions 2024 qualification. The win marks EDG's fifth domestic title in a row, a streak that began May 2023. They have also been the best-performing Chinese team at a VCT international event, reaching the top-six twice. This series is the second time both teams have faced off in a grand final. FunPlus Phoenix won the previous matchup 3-1, back in 2022. Despite that win, the record between the two prior to Kickoff was 8-3 in EDG's favor. FPX's map pick, Breeze, opened the best-of-five. EDG found an early lead on their defense, with CHICHOO 's Cypher taking on a protagonist role throughout the half. His setups helped punish the opponent's double duelist composition, mitigating their impact to such an extent that ZmjjKK had more than twice Autumn 's and Life 's combined eliminations. It was not a clean half, however. FPX still won five rounds after losing the pistol, and they were able to keep rounds close. They bounced back on offense, where they won the first four rounds comfortably. This put EDG at a disadvantage for the first time in the match, but they managed to keep their score on par with their rivals. CHICHOO and Haodong win a miracle round FPX then won another two rounds to grant them map point. Not content with a looming FPX win, CHICHOO gave a lurking masterclass on round 23 to save a 2v5. FPX seemed to crumble afterwards, not putting up much resistance in the final three rounds. Once again, map two began with EDG taking the lead. They were able to win five rounds in a row, aided by three first kills from ZmjjKK. BerLIN and AAAAY helped turn their luck around, eventually tying the score at 5-5. A botched attempt at preventing the plant gave EDG their sixth round, and a triple kill from ZmjjKK sealed the half 7-5. Overall, ZmjjKK was involved in nine initial encounters on attack, winning six and only dying first 3 times. He ended the half with 13 kills, closely followed by Smoggy 's 12 CHICHOO pushes to win a 1v1 EDward Gaming continued to extend their lead on the second half. They won the pistol round, and a lingering Snake Bite prevented FPX from winning EDG's bonus round. A lurk from autumn helped win the following round, but a 1v1 and subsequent 4K from CHICHOO put his team on map point. Again with their backs against the wall, FPX looked lost on the final round. A missed Showstopper and well placed smoke gave nobody a triple kill, enough for his team to end the map 13-6. Icebox was FunPlus Phoenix's chance at redemption. Reyna-Jett was their chosen duelist pairing, and it initially paid off for them. The duelist duo had a strong beginning to the map, together winning the first four rounds in a row. EDG was able to identify Life's overeagerness and FPX's weak B site, two factors they capitalized on to win five rounds of their own. The two teams then traded rounds to end the half 6-6. FPX dismantle EDG thanks to an Autumn 3K Autumn led the scoreboard going into the second half, and he continued the performance the next couple of rounds with 2 first kills to open their attack. EDG won the bonus round, but two successful site holds and a clutch from Life extended the round differential. The next round, a correct gamble stack and isolated 1v1s gave EDG an eco win. Eventually, FPX was able to win two close rounds, winning their first map of the series 13-8. Statistically, autumn stood out above the rest of the players, totalling 25 eliminations. He also had a 4-1 first-kill to first-death ratio, compared to ZmjjKK's 5-6. AAAAY was not far behind with 19 eliminations, finding crucial kills on defense that halted EDG's attacking ideas. Both teams went into Ascent using non-traditional comps, with FPX on the same agents they picked against Dragon Ranger Gaming and EDG opting for a comp that appeared tailor made to counter FPX's. FunPlus Phoenix put themselves ahead to start off the map, winning their third bonus round of the day. After taking the first five rounds of the half, EDG's counterstratting started to show, in turn helping them win six rounds in a row. Not only are both teams playing unique Ascent comps, EDG's is handpicked to counter FPX's. The shallow Viper's Pit allows CHICHOO to push comfortably while denying information for common Cypher setups EDG use a Snake Bite to break Cypher's Spycam over B Main After winning the second pistol round, FPX found another streak of round wins. EDG fought back, using ZmjjKK as spearhead for early pushes and chaotic retakes. Three rounds later, FPX were able to claw back from a 3v5 to get them to map point. Two failed pushes onto A followed, and EDG dragged the map to overtime. The teams went back-and-forth, but in the end EDG scored the final blow, winning the series 16-14."

    "cleaned_content": "Yesterday, Karmine Corp and Team Heretics shocked the world by upsetting FNATIC and Natus Vincere to secure slots at Masters: Madrid . Today, the roars of the French crowd drowned out the Spaniards as Karmine Corp defeated Team Heretics 3-1 to win EMEA's Kickoff whilst claiming a first seed at Spain's first masters event. Despite losing out in today's Bo5, Team Heretics will still book tickets to Madrid alongside their rivals, albeit as EMEA's second seed. The last time either of the two teams made appearances on the world stage was at 2023's LOCK//IN event nearly a year ago. They proved us all wrong. (Photo: Michal Konkol/Riot Games) Karmine Corp had played Team Heretics earlier in the event in Group A's winner match, where things did not go as smoothly. This time, however, the French organization managed to enact its revenge on the Heretics in a four-map series. The first destination for the two teams was Sunset, a map on which Team Heretics had successfully performed a rigorous comeback against NAVI just yesterday. Eager to keep up their performance, Heretics started their defensive half in top form, with the lowest-rated player of the first 12 rounds being Boo standing at a 1.30 rating, while his younger brother MiniBoo played at a whopping 1.85 on Neon. After racking up nine rounds on defense alone, Team Heretics initially stumbled in their attacking half, but managed to close it out after a timeout from neilzinho stopped Karmine Corp's momentum and allowed his team to steal away the French's map pick. On Cypher, 21 kills and five first bloods was only the beginning of benjyfishy 's standout performance. Reality struck Heretics hard on Lotus, where Karmine Corp took an explosive lead early on after flattening defensive contenders on the A site in consecutive fashion. Despite both timeouts being burned early by their opponents, N4RRATE and and marteen could not be stopped as the Corp entered the second half with an 11-1 scoreline. Heretics were unable to capitalize off of benjyfishy's stellar performance on Lotus. This time, it was their adversaries who were shut down just as they were building momentum; a 0.49 second defuse by N4RRATE and a 2v2 retake by sh1n and marteen wrapped Lotus up in a neat bow for Karmine Corp and set the stage for Map three in the form of Icebox. The chants of the French crowd kept N4RRATE and marteen warm, as the duo once again outshined the rest of the server as they spearheaded retakes and site executions alike. The youngsters spread 28 kills between each other and solidified an 8-4 scoreline and put their adversaries on the back foot. After converting their bonus, Karmine Corp cruised their way to an easy 13-7 scoreline, playing with their food on the attacking half the entire way. Multi-kills galore plagued Heretics throughout Icebox, and only benjyfishy was able to finish the map with a positive K/D. One map away from redeeming last year's performance, Karmine Corp kept their foot on the pedal and blitzed their way through Split. Despite losing the pistol, the troupe only allowed their opponents to win two more rounds on their defensive half to set up an 8-4 scoreline. This time, sh1n was the one to step up when his team needed it most, opting to play ratty positions as Astra while providing necessary support for his team. On Karmine Corp's attacking half, an ace from the Frenchman followed by a clutch the very next round brought the score to a dominant 12-5. Sensing the end, Heretics were only able to net one more round before a fast B site execute sent them away with a second-place finish. Just in case you missed it the first time for whatever reason. North America's import proved to be one of the two difference-makers on the side of Karmine Corp, as N4RRATE joined marteen as the top fraggers with 77 and 76 kills respectively, 13 above the next contender. benjyfishy's efforts could not be ignored, as the impact he had throughout all four maps helped keep the games closer than his opponents had hoped, highlighted by his 227 ACS. Karmine Corp's victory over Team Heretics cements them as EMEA's reigning champion and awards them with three Championship Points on their road to the biggest event of the year. Although there was no prize for second place, Heretics still look to be a contender as they will soon return to their roots in Spain in front of a home crowd. Six of the eight teams at Madrid have been solidified, and tomorrow, the final two from the Americas Kickoff will be determined between Evil Geniuses , LOUD , Sentinels , and NRG . Spain's Masters event is set to begin March 14, just two weeks away. The rest of the teams that did not qualify from the regional tournaments will use this time to prepare for the next stage of competition in hopes of reaching the international stage."

    "cleaned_content": "FunPlus Phoenix and EDward Gaming have continued their reign as the international representatives for China with clean 2-0 wins over Dragon Ranger Gaming and Trace Esports to qualify for Masters Madrid 2024 . FPX comfortably take care of DRG 2-0 FunPlus Phoenix have once again qualified for an international event. Despite the squad's young average age of 20.4, Australian rookie Autumn is the only newcomer to the international scene. The team's core of AAAAY , BerLIN , and Lysoar previously attended Champions 2023 , while Life played with EDG at Champions 2022 and Attacking Soul Esports at Masters Tokyo 2023 . Dragon Ranger Gaming can be proud of having made it the farthest of any Ascension graduates after G2 Esports were eliminated in the Play-In stage, while BLEED and Gentle Mates were eliminated in groups without a series win. The first series of the day opened on Ascent. FPX got off to a strong 4-0 start after a pistol win and bonus round conversion. This forced an early timeout from DRG head coach 1t that ultimately proved futile as FPX read the situation perfectly, executing a full retake setup on the B site to gain a 6-0 lead. DRG found relief after a 1v3 clutch from nizhaoTZH gave way to take their first round and gain a slight bit of momentum heading into the second half with an 8-4 deficit. DRG hoped to make a comeback in the second half with a pistol win and a bonus round conversion to keep the score even at 8-8. Life's Yoru came alive in the map's later rounds as FPX manipulated the DRG defense perfectly to take sites with ease. Strong individual performances from the entire FPX squad secured strong post-plants throughout the half. Hero plays from TvirusLuke and TZH provided little resistance to a dominant FPX that quickly found themselves on map point at 12-10. FPX closed out Ascent with a clean and simple A rush to take a 1-0 series lead. The duelist duo of Life and autumn dominated the server with 269 and 228 ACS respectively. Lysoar had to win a 1v3 to secure his team's first round. Breeze began similarly to Ascent, with FPX getting off to a flying 7-0 start. DRG seemed to have no answer for FPX's unorthodox Astra comp as Life's Jett was given space to run rampant across the map. A 1v2 from Dingwei brought DRG their first round, however, this would prove to be a minor footnote in an overall commanding map from FPX. DRG found themselves on the backfoot of a 9-3 scoreline coming into half-time with all of their stars having gone missing. vo0kashu 's lurks couldn't find any impact on the attack and TvirusLuke's entries were quickly mitigated by FPX. DRG managed to take a laboured pistol round thanks to a 1v2 from TZH, but continued to struggle come the gun rounds. Life found an impressive 4k on DRG's bonus round to bring FPX back on track to Masters qualification. FPX's heavy mid control went unanswered by DRG as the favorites proceeded to drop just a single round before ending the map 13-6 and the series 2-0. FPX have qualified for their third international event. FPX have qualified for Masters Madrid 2024 and will face off against EDG in the VCT Kickoff Finals for three VCT championship points, the only points available in the Kickoff. EDG handled Trace 2-0 to make Madrid EDward Gaming will make their way onto the international stage once again after a 2-0 victory over Trace Esports. EDG have participated in four international events in the past and made a breakout run at Masters Tokyo 2023, taking wins over Natus Vincere , T1 , and LOUD . Trace qualified for the Playoffs via the Play-In stage, playing 15 maps over the course of the Kickoff compared to EDG's five. The heybay -led squad eliminated Bilibili Gaming and Titan Esports Club en route to the playoffs and have ended their Kickoff run at 3-4th place. Trace started strong on Sunset, neutralizing EDG in the first two gun rounds after a pistol loss to take a brief 3-2 lead. EDG responded with a force-buy and a timeout from coach AfteR to tie up the score at 3-3. Despite brief hiccups, EDG were largely in control for the remainder of the half with strong performances coming from the trio of ZmjjKK , CHICHOO , and Smoggy to secure a narrow 7-5 lead. EDG once again picked up the pistol and conversion to take a comfortable 9-5 lead before Trace could fully come back into the game. A 3v5 win in the bonus and an excellent first gun round for Trace heavily shifted the momentum of the map in the underdog's favour. A missed Showstopper from ZmjjKK's Raze spelled disaster for EDG and allowed Trace to even the score at 9-9. High-impact rounds from Kai and heybay put Trace on the edge of map point at 11-9 before EDG found success in a half-buy round off the back of a 3k from nobody . Clean trades and plenty of proactivity from EDG put the Chinese heavyweights on map point at 12-11 and into a 4v2 situation in the 24th round. Despite Trace being gifted overtime by a miraculous 4k from YOU , another 4k from ZmjjKK at 13-12 allowed EDG to close out the first map by the narrowest of margins at 14-12. Fan-favorite ZmjjKK ended the first map topping the server with 308 ACS and 26 kills. YOU brought his team to overtime with an impressive 4k. Unfortunately for the underdogs, Bind would prove to be a much more one-sided affair. A pistol win for Trace was immediately met with an eco win from EDG owing to a hero Bulldog buy from ZmjjKK's KAY/O. EDG's economy was now thriving after the thrifty and a win in the following gun round led the way for a dominant first half from the favorites. Clutch plays came the way of EDG from the likes of nobody and Haodong , while ZmjjKK carried over his strong performance from Sunset to take the first half 8-4. EDG conceded the second pistol to Trace but would not falter for the remainder of the series. Every remaining round went EDG's way in convincing fashion as Trace had little to show on their opponent's map pick. An ice-cold defuse from Smoggy prevented a 1v3 clutch from heybay to put EDG on map and series point at 12-6. Haodong's squad proceeded to take the following round without breaking a sweat to secure the series 2-0 and qualify for Masters Madrid. Smoggy stuck the defuse to put EDG on series point. EDG will play in the VCT China Kickoff finals versus FPX tomorrow to take home three VCT championship points, the only points available in the Kickoff."

    "cleaned_content": "A day of unexpected results saw Team Heretics and Karmine Corp flatten Natus Vincere and FNATIC , two of EMEA's historically best teams. Both matches ended 2-0, eliminating the favorites from EMEA Kickoff and granting the victors an opportunity to win 3 Championship points in the grand final. These results mean EMEA will send nine players without previous international experience to Masters Madrid . Only MAGNUM has gone to a Masters or Champions event. Team Heretics surprise NAVI with 2-0 win Team Heretics have defeated NAVI 2-0, marking the first time they have qualified to an international VCT event. The org had really only found success in 2020 and 2021, when they won First Strike Europe and reached the Masters 1 EMEA grand final. Their stand-in, paTiTek , will continue to play throughout Madrid. The loss means NAVI will miss an event for the first time since Masters Reykjavík in 2022. They qualified but were unable to attend the LAN due to multiple visa issues and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Their accolades include winning Masters Copenhagen and top four finishes at Champions 2022 and LOCK//IN. The series opened on Sunset. A quick plant on B let Heretics win the pistol round, followed by an anti-eco win. A series of crucial kills from ardiis helped put them up 4-2, and they would win two more rounds. Eventually, their opponent's timeout adaptations came in, letting them win another two rounds and ending the half 8-4 in NAVI's favor. Neon, and lack thereof, made the difference early in the second half. Team Heretics was able to use their aggressive potential to make early pushes into the attacking team. NAVI, on the other hand, struggled to enter sites and finish off rounds. This helped Heretics bring the map to overtime. NAVI struggled to find an advantage on their attack The two teams remained comfortable on defense, winning two rounds each. Timeouts were used from both parties in an effort to break the side, which only came until round 28. Team Heretics won the attack, and a correct B site stack helped them finish the win. Heretics continued their aggression heading into Breeze. Despite the map being their opponent's pick, NAVI was confident after 13-6 and 13-7 wins. MiniBoo had momentum on his side, however, and completely took over the series. Across the first seven rounds, MiniBoo had 17 eliminations and only died once. NAVI was able to win a pair of consolation rounds, but Heretics continued to dominate their attack. Panic appeared to set in for NAVI, who only managed to win two more rounds. Only five rounds were played in the second half, and eventually Team Heretics concluded the match. Heretics' setup helps win the round The best performing player was their duelist, MiniBoo. He ended the series with a 49-29 KD and a 1.49 rating. The team has shown great understanding on how to play into his aggression, setting him up for eight triple kills across the series. Also of note was RieNs , close behind in rating with a 1.38. In the post-match interview, paTiTek commented on his return to the top of EMEA. “It's just hard work,” he said. “Hard work and being professional got me here.” He also addressed the community's pre-season expectations. “You put us in D-Tier? I think we're S-Tier, yeah?” paTiTek said. Karmine Corp crush FNATIC's hopes with 2-0 win The second series of the day featured Karmine Corp, who boasted a 3-11 record across all of VCT 2023, against FNATIC, the best EMEA team of 2023 and first team to win two international events. Prior to playoffs, Karmine Corp had played the maximum number of matches possible: three in the group stage and three in the play-in stage. FNATIC, meanwhile, only played one match to make playoffs, a victory against Team Vitality. Outside of DRX, who acquired Vision Strikers in early 2022, FNATIC held the longest streak for international appearances by any org in Valorant. The loss caps it off at a total of seven, and is only the second time the team has missed an international event. FNATIC picked Lotus to kick off their match. Starting on offense, they gained the advantage early on multiple rounds, but their opponents were ready to retaliate. Karmine Corp focused on a retake heavy setup, prioritizing coordination and delays over map control or site anchoring. This granted them eight rounds on their defense, a lead that they kept until the end of the map. The six round deficit is the worst FNATIC has had on any half of Lotus since its introduction, only matched on two occasions, and never exceeded by any team. tomaszy saves the round They recovered on the second half, but the lead was too much to overcome. tomaszy was the highlight of their attack. He ended the half with a 1.84 rating and 306 ACS, and won a couple of rounds on his own. He found two separate quad kills, capping off those rounds with a clutch. “They played the same Lotus as before,” coach ENGH said after the match. “They were scared of tomaszy,” marteen added. Mirroring the first series of the day, Karmine Corp carried their momentum onto their map, Split. After winning the pistol, tomaszy got another 4K on round 2. Once again, Karmine Corp took the lead, thanks in part to their double duelist, double controller comp. N4RRATE 's Raze found four first kills and 12 total eliminations in the half. The Yoru set play catches Alfajer The French org was clearly well-drilled. Engh's ideas paired well with the players at his disposal, and they were able to catch FNATIC off guard on multiple occasions. Their reads and set plays allowed marteen to run circles around FNATIC, as he ended the defense with four first-kills of his own an a 2.31 rating. Derke and Chronicle did their best to fight back, the latter winning a 1v2 on round 15. FNATIC looked lost by the end of the match, and were ultimately only able to win three rounds on their attack, ending the map 13-8. With this win Karmine Corp join LOUD and Team Liquid as one of the few teams able to take a victory against FNATIC. When asked about playing against Derke, marteen was unfazed. “I'm just better,” he said. “I barely felt any pressure.”"

    "cleaned_content": "Only three teams had a chance at playoffs: Trace Esports , Titan Esports Club , and Bilibili Gaming . Unlike other regions where the format was a regular round-robin, VCT China had Trace and TEC play first. The loser would face Bilibili immediately while the winner would face BLG in the following match. In the end, Trace triumphed as they handled Titan, trudged past Bilibili in two overtime maps, and moved on to the playoffs, keeping their hopes alive for a spot at Masters: Madrid. Trace take down Titan after first map overtime loss Titan Esports began the game on Breeze with four straight rounds until Trace stopped the momentum by winning five of their own. A timeout from Trace in round 10 allowed Trace to wrap the first half 7-5. The second half started with a pistol and anti-eco win for TEC, but a series of back-and-forth rounds ensued where both teams tried to outdo one another with two very different styles. Trace's aggressive assault got the upper hand by round 22, but Titan's slow and methodical maneuvering got the map to overtime. The quintuple overtime featured otherworldly plays and clutches, starting off with FengF 's 1v2 clutch to keep Trace alive at 13-13. Rb 's 16 hp clutch on round 28 once again left overtime going and gave Titan matchpoint after his 4k on round 29 defense. FengF replicated Rb's defense with a 3K of his own the round after, and Trace furthered along to 16-15 with a solid attack. In the end, Titan won the next three rounds with a strong B push, a 1v1 clutch defuse from LockM , and a mid crunch to A, securing the first map in a grueling 18-16. Despite losing the overtime slugfest, Trace Esports outperformed their opponents, scoring 22 first kills, ten more than TEC. Unsurprisingly, FengF's 40 kills nearly gave TE a lead in the game, but Titan stood strong with kawaii 's 30-25 and Rb's 29-25 KDRs. Rb stands for “raid boss.” Trace moved on to Lotus, their pick but also a map that TEC had never lost until today. The odds were in favor of Trace as they started their attack side 8-0 and only lost rounds 9 and 12 due to a retake and a 1v1 clutch by LockM, thereby ending the half 10-2. Despite losing the pistol, Titan clawed back with four straight rounds and were primed to win a fifth until LockM got a taste of his own play as YOU stuck the defuse, bringing Trace to matchpoint. In-game leader heybay 's C-hold stopped Titan in their tracks and tied the series 1-1. Trace's solid teamplay earned them ten rounds on their attack half, and everyone but Kai had a positive KDA and had more kills than Rb in both statistics. FengF once again topped the charts with his 19-11 KD and 302 ACS. The final map Split was another story of Trace starting out with a large advantage, this time by five rounds straight before conceding round six from TEC's three-man retake. Three more rounds for Trace had TEC pull through with two more retakes, save for losing round 11 – leaving Trace with a 9-3 lead. Like on Lotus, Titan pulled through after losing the pistol and anti-eco with five more rounds of their own, thanks to Rb's aggression in A and mid ropes. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough as Trace won the next two rounds flawlessly and ended the map 13-8. Rb was a crucial element for TEC's success as he outperformed all Trace players, including his Raze counterpart FengF, with 24-14 KD and 322 ACS. As for Trace, Kai's impact and flexibility earned him the MVP for map 3. Bilibili sweep tired Titan Having faced a loss on their undefeated map, Titan opened the game by picking Lotus. However, even after winning the first two rounds, Bilibili fought back with five rounds of their own. TEC would only win one more round as BLG swept past with eight more rounds, including a 1v1 clutch amongst IGLs in the final round – in which B3ar came out on top to win 13-3. As the pattern continued, all the BLG players outperformed their counterparts, with Rb being his team's only positive KDA player. Even after losing the pistol and anti-eco rounds, Bilibili continued their thrashing on Ascent as they won six more rounds in a row, thanks to Knight and whzy stifling their opponents. However, Titan managed to stop the bleeding by winning three of the four rounds remaining and trail halftime 5-7. BLG started the second half by ending all of Titan's momentum with a strong defense, leading to matchpoint in five rounds, with round 16 featuring a quick eco 4K for ace whzy. Titan came back with three consolation rounds from Rb and kawaii's post-plant holds, but BLG wrapped the map 13-8 the round after. Titan Esports Club were completely stunned by BLG's whzy, who racked up 25 kills and 314 ACS to his tally. The next closest was once again Rb with 17 kills and 225 ACS. TEC are set to return in April. Just a normal whzy 4K. Trace survive against Bilibili and qualify for playoffs The third and final series was Trace Esports awaiting Bilibili Gaming and the final chance to qualify for playoffs. Trace started the game with Lotus, as both teams had dominant wins over TEC on the map earlier today. However, Bilibili had the upper hand as they tallied up four straight rounds on defense. A chaotic round 5 post-plant gave TE their first round, but BLG never stood firm and gave Trace only three rounds to BLG's nine. Trace entered the second half with wins on the pistol and anti-eco, but after losing the bonus, Flex1n clutched in a critical 1v3 4K to defuse, turning the momentum for TE. Following another win and two losses – in which BLG came to matchpoint at 12-7 – Trace fought tooth-and-nail to stay in the game, winning four more rounds to bring the game to round 24. With only one round left, Bilibili came out on top and took the first map. Cool, calm, and collected. Bilibili then moved to Sunset, one of TE's weaker maps. Once again, BLG started the game with four straight rounds, but after an early timeout by coach destroyeR , Trace managed to turn the tides by winning six of their own, leading 6-4. Bilibili tied up the half 6-6 thanks to two 1v1 clutch defuses from Biank and Knight, respectively. The second half had Bilibili and Trace exchanging rounds after rounds, as both teams were down by one or two rounds. From round 21, TE moved to matchpoint after winning three rounds in a row, but B3Ar denied a defuse with his 4K and Bilibili won the final regulation round. Overtime would only last two phases as both teams won their attacks, but Trace closed the map out with their defense in round 28. Bilibili had 19 first kills to Trace's 10, while FengF and yosemite both earned 28 kills, and the rest of Trace had a positive KDA and above 15 kills. The final map was Bind, and unlike the first two in the series, Trace led their defensive half 8-4 from a flawless pistol. For the rounds that Bilibili won, yosemite and whzy played a big role as their fragging and shutdowns were crucial. Despite the slow start in the first half, BLG came back strong with their defense, always leaving Trace at a loss with their solid retakes and stalwart holds. With the game at 11-10, TE fired back with two rounds, the first being a 2v3 postplant hold from YOU and Flex1n by using the latter's Viper pit. The second was a flawless fast B push that left two BLG players saving. Round 24 featured yet another B push. TE seemed poised to win the game with Flex1n's 3K, but whzy clutched the 2v2 and defused, moving the game to the day's third and final overtime. Overtime went only for two rounds, but was a close affair. Bilibili's A push led Trace to attempt a 5v5 retake. Kills went back and forth, with Yosemite getting three, but Kai and heybay stopped the postplant and defused. The final round was yet another A push from TE but knight opened the round with two kills and FengF traded with two more. Int a 3v3 post-plant, Flex1n's molly delayed yosemite and B3Ar, but FengF and Flex1n whittled the clock down second by second. With the BLG players getting the final kills, it seemed that overtime would continue, but the game was decided by only 0.13 seconds left on the clock, leaving the spike to explode and Trace to victory. Ex-BLG substitute Kai showed his former team why he should've been a starter, as he racked up 29 kills with only 15 deaths, the lowest from anyone on the server. The next closest was Yosemite, with 23 kills and 16 deaths. Saved by the… spike. Trace will face EDward Gaming in playoffs, with the match scheduled for March 1. Bilibili will return to competition in April for VCT China Split 1."

    "cleaned_content": "Sentinels have qualified to the VCT 2024 Americas Kickoff playoff stage, beating MIBR 2-0 and losing a close series to G2 Esports 2-1 to get in via map differential. This means that both MIBR and G2 Esports are eliminated from the Kickoff event and cannot play at Masters Madrid. Sentinels stomp MIBR in first regional play-in match The series saw the maps of Split from Sentinels, Ascent from MIBR, leaving the decider of Sunset, which ended up not being needed. The play-in match day all began with Sentinels versus MIBR, with the first map pick of Split leading to some expected compositions. MIBR ran the double duelist of Jett and Raze, while Sentinels leaned back on the Cypher, Viper, Skye, and Omen. Split started in Sentinels' favor, fitting for a team that had looked comfortable on the map. The map pick started with their defense side, a pistol win, and a bonus conversion from johnqt . Due to that bonus win, the lead built up to 5-0 for Sentinels, and just kept going up. It took until round 10 for MIBR to win their first attack round, ending the half down 10-2. MIBR took pistol off of a great, aggressive push from jzz , but even the improvements weren't enough, as they lost the map 13-7. Map two was Ascent, MIBR's pick, with the two teams running slightly different comps, with different sentinel and initiator agents. MIBR got the pistol win on their attack, even getting four enemies down in the bonus to whittle down Sentinels' economy. After playing across the map, Sentinels adapted by hunkering down on sites, letting MIBR roam and waste time while not giving up early picks. The conservative play led to a small 7-5 lead for Sentinels heading into the half. Winning pistol and a bonus conversion for the second half only extended the lead for Sentinels, with TenZ stepping up to stop any aggression from MIBR. The bonus conversion knocked MIBR's chances of map victory down, and Sentinels took advantage to win the map 13-6, and the series 2-0. With this win, TenZ remarked post-match that their second match of the day against G2 Esports “should be easy.” MIBR force scrappy win over G2, but can't make playoffs G2 Esports' team for the VCT 2024 season. (Image via G2 Esports) The maps for this series were Sunset for G2, Split for MIBR, and the decider was Breeze. Sunset started well for G2 Esports, winning pistol on their defense. MIBR seemed to have watched G2's loss to Evil Geniuses on Sunset, where lurks through mid caught them off guard. However, G2 recognized their mistakes from the EG game and held passively instead, often getting free kills in mid early. Then, the modern classic G2 Sunset choke came around once again, and the momentum went from a confident 6-2 to tied at 6-6. A pistol win gave MIBR an opportunity to run away with the map, and G2 crumbled. Ever since losing a 1v3 round on their defense side while being ahead significantly, G2 only won three rounds afterward, losing their map pick 13-9. Going down one map early on for G2 meant now, effectively, the only way they could make it to the playoff section was by winning both this game and their next one against Sentinels. Considering how easily Sentinels dispatched MIBR and how G2 collapsed on Sunset for what felt like the umpteenth time, the mood for G2 fans wasn't high. Split had to be the comeback for G2, and it was MIBR's map pick. MIBR ran the double duelist composition, unchanged from their loss against Sentinels, while G2 ran the Breach. MIBR won the pistol on their attack, and even converted the bonus. A 5-0 deficit led to a timeout, but G2 did pull it back slightly to only be down 7-5 at the half. Winning their attack pistol, G2 successfully brought the game back to even. This is when, for the first time in the match, rounds were truly traded back and forth, instead of constant runs from either squad. A late lead from G2 was followed by back to back flawless rounds from MIBR to tie it at 11-11, eventually heading to overtime. Off of some explosive entries from leaf, G2 won the map 15-13 and took the series to Breeze. Compositions for Breeze were very different, where MIBR ran the default comp with Jett and KAYO, but G2 picked Yoru and Harbor instead. MIBR won a chaotic pistol round, converting their bonus, but G2 hit back immediately with some clever Yoru plays, as well as some clutch Harbor defuses. The half ended tied, 6-6. A confident 4K from trent on pistol got G2 the lead, but rounds were traded as it went on. Then, after losing a 1v3 with a lead for the second time in the day, the map ended 13-10. It was a rough look compared to how strong G2 looked when they qualified for the play-ins. The win wasn't even positive for MIBR, as the map was close enough that no matter the map scores in the G2 and Sentinels game, they could not mathematically win the round-robin. G2 now needed to post two map wins to qualify for Madrid, while Sentinels just needed one. Sentinels lose series against G2 but make playoffs anyway The playoff implications came down to one series, with G2 needing to be perfect. Sentinels' pick of Sunset and G2's pick of Breeze both had to go in G2's favor. If we saw the decider map of Split, it was already essentially over, with Sentinels making it through. Sentinels swapped compositions and moved Sacy on the Gekko, while G2 played their regular comp. Pistol went in G2's way, and the game was moving at a very fast pace for both teams as G2 took an 8-4 lead. Sentinels won the second pistol round and clawed back some rounds, but the bonus conversion made the map scary for G2 as their lead was erased. Their defensive strategy was to play for retakes, using their frequent flashes and grenades to clear out sites all at once, and G2 was struggling to work around it. Even after a timeout, Sentinels remained perfect on defense. Sentinels truly had a better read on the map, as their composition and coordination led to a 13-8 win. Sentinels win the play-in portion of the VCT 2024 NA Kickoff tournament. (Image via Sentinels) That map win secured Sentinels their playoff spot, while G2 lost another significant lead on Sunset. Due to the 13-8 scoreline, even two 13-0 wins on the next two maps from G2 couldn't get them that playoff slot. The results of these final two maps didn't matter for the outcome of the tournament, outside of seeding for Champions points. When Breeze came along, G2 ran the same comp they lost to MIBR with. Sentinels decided to run their standard Breeze comp, not showing any unique strategies they could surprise enemies with in the future. After a pistol win, G2 converted their bonus with a 4K clutch from trent. As the lead built up, neT decided to flank deep into enemy lines as Cypher, catching even zekken off-guard, as G2 Esports changed from a slow team to a lightning-fast team. Exiting the half up 9-3, G2 looked to potentially extend this game to a third map, but Sentinels once again started the second half with a pistol win and a bonus conversion. Afterward, G2 fought back and closed out the map 13-9, extending the series to Split. Both neT and leaf turned up in this second map, needing to keep it up if they wanted the bragging rights of the series win. Mirroring the end of the G2 and MIBR match, Split had the opportunity of having the team that won the match still lose their playoff spot. Breach returned for G2, while Sentinels ran a regular Split composition to avoid showing strats. Despite a mid-pistol advertisement for the Sentinels classic from Zellsis , it went in G2's favor. As the half went on, Sentinels started reading more into G2's executes, finishing the half up 7-5. Whether it was G2 showing knowledge of how to get around Sentinels' attack plans, or just a lack of caring from Sentinels due to their successful playoff qualification, G2 closed the map out 13-9. They won the series, giving them some hope heading into the regular season, but won't be in the playoffs or at Masters Madrid."

    "cleaned_content": "With one spot in the EMEA Kickoff playoffs up for grabs, KCorp, Vitality, and KOI battled in a round robin play-in stage to sort it out. In dominant fashion, KCorp waltzed their way to a top-four finish. A 2-0 victory over a Vitality squad still playing without trexx gave KCorp an early lead, and once Vitality rolled over KOI 2-0, KCorp only needed a single map win against a crumbling KOI. They didn't wait for a close dramatic finish as they easily took the first map to secure their playoff berth. Banner image by Wojciech Wandzel/Riot Games Coming into the year, all three of these teams picked up rookie talent from the Challengers circuit while testing inexperienced IGLs. KCorp chose MAGNUM to IGL as an experienced veteran who previously played under IGLs like Boaster and Enzo. Vitality moved their IGL mantle to ceNder after BONECOLD retired, and KOI did the same with starxo after dropping Koldamenta. Ironically, starxo has become the third member of the original Acend squad to become an IGL after BONECOLD and Koldamenta. KCorp picked and won Sunset cleanly against both opponents. The quick adoption of the newest map as one of their strengths paid off in a big way. N4RRATE popped off both times as by far the highest rated Gekko player in the VCT leagues thus far. Combined, Vitality and KOI won just two full buy rounds on the map. The only challenge KCorp faced during their play-in run came on Ascent versus Vitality. They ran an old Paper Rex composition with the Harbor/Viper duo that has fallen out of the meta along with Raze, Reyna, and the recently nerfed Skye. Head on a swivel. The abundance of smokes and the double duelist gave KCorp's attack significant punch despite the defender-sided nature of the map. However, the lack of a Sentinel gave their defense trouble. It required retakes in the final two rounds of regulation for KCorp to force overtime, but they converted the map in the end. For their part, Vitality bounced back against KOI. Although they tried to throw a 10-2 start on Sunset, they brushed their opponents aside. Across the play-in stage, Sayf stepped up for his team. Having stepped aside from the star duelist role to accommodate runneR, he had been struggling to put up the same kinds of numbers that he achieved on Liquid last year. His 1.32 rating ranked third in the play-in stage only behind marteen and N4RRATE who mopped up in blowouts. Content KCorp easily dealt with KOI to secure their place in the playoffs. After KCorp won Sunset, the result was guaranteed, and they let their stars loose on Bind to clean up the series. They only had to take one true eco round across both maps. Now this is what team skins were made for. With these results, the playoffs for EMEA have been set. KCorp will have the daunting task of playing FNATIC for a spot in Madrid while Heretics will face off against NAVI. Both games will take place on Thursday, February 29th."

    "cleaned_content": "Cloud9 and KRÜ Esports lost to MIBR and G2 Esports in their respective decisive deciders, while Sentinels took down LEVIATÁN in Group B to complete the play-ins stage matchups. Cloud9, Leviatán, and KRÜ are eliminated from Americas Kickoff and Masters Madrid qualification. MIBR eliminate Cloud9, advance to play-ins The series was a rematch of both teams' opener in Group A, where Cloud9 squeezed out a close 2-1 victory over MIBR. The series would begin on Bind, just as it had in the team's first matchup. The first go around on Bind saw Cloud9 win in the last round of regulation. MIBR would opt to switch up their composition from the previous game, switching up a couple roles and bringing in a KAY/O for a Jett. After Cloud9 opened with four straight on defense, MIBR reversed the momentum entirely. The Brazilians pieced together seven straight rounds buoyed by constant opening picks before recycling the previous Bind halftime score of 7-5. Please notice the NA molly at the beginning of the clip. That momentum would continue to start the second half, as MIBR jumped out to a 10-5 lead enabled by a Cloud9 force buy loss. The North American squad then used both OXY 's Yoru teleports and the map teleporters themselves to maneuver masterfully across the map, throwing out constant fakes and rotations to leave the MIBR defense without a clue. The back-and-forth affair would eventually be decided in overtime, where OXY would be left in two different 1v2 clutch situations after failed pushes by Cloud9. The rookie duelist would be shut down in both attempts, putting MIBR just one map from the play-ins stage. xeppaa didn't have the best series, but when he's on, he's on. Despite a hot start from Xeppaa on defense, MIBR's attack side on their map pick proved strong off the back of their own starlike performances from RgLMeister and jzz . MIBR opened with another streak of four rounds on their defense, which was too much for Cloud9 to overcome as MIBR moved on to the play-ins. An off-meta comp for MIBR seemed to cause a few problems for Cloud9. MIBR moves into the play-ins stage, awaiting the second-place teams from the other groups on Monday for a chance to make the playoffs stage. Cloud9 has been eliminated from Americas Kickoff after losses to NRG and MIBR. “Our comps on the first matchup didn't work very much,” rglmeister said post-match. “A lot of the credit goes to mazin for the win; his calls were working very well for us.” Sentinels move to play-ins, eliminate Leviatán The second match of the day saw a hyped matchup between fan favorite Sentinels and potential Americas superteam Leviatán for a spot at the play ins stage with MIBR. Sentinels defeated Leviatán across three maps to secure their spot in the Americas Kickoff play-ins stage. Leviatán lost two straight against LOUD and Sentinels after winning their opening match versus 100 Thieves in a tough group. Sentinels did the opposite, winning two straight to keep their Masters Madrid hopes alive. Sentinels opted to start the match on Split, a map that Leviatán had looked shaky on against LOUD. The choice proved a great decision for sentinels, as they opened with a 9-3 lead despite the double duelist comp from Leviatán. Sentinels put together retake after retake on the defense side, complimented by impressive individual plays. The final score was 13-3 on Split, with just kiNgg and aspas the only players on Leviatán with more than seven kills. zekken was the star for Sentinels, producing 228 ADR to spearhead the dominant victory. The rest of the squad was not far behind, contributing four clutches and two 4K's. The bald buff is real. Breeze was a different story as Leviatán flipped the script of the first map, jumping out to a 9-3 lead on their own map pick. kiNgg and aspas again lead the way to keep their team's Madrid aspirations alive. The pace and confidence that Leviatán played with on the attack gave Sentinels fits, and the known starpower of the players shone through. Sentinels responded a bit better than their counterparts did when faced with a large deficit, but not by much. Leviatán would close out Breeze comfortably with a 13-6 scoreline. aspas looked right at home, putting out 188 ADR to lead the lobby. The series would be decided on Bind, a map that Leviatán was already 2-0 on in Kickoff, and that Sentinels had lost their only matchup on against 100 Thieves 13-6. Leviatán began with a 4-0 lead after a bonus round win on defense, but Sentinels by ramping up the speed of their hits on their double duelist composition. That speed overwhelmed the anchors for Leviatán Sacy in particular traded his teammates out extremely well and came close to some insane clutches on the way to lead his team with 12 kills at a 6-6 half. An absurdly close pistol combined with a bonus round win of their own catapulted Sentinels to a 10-6 lead on defense. If LEV was going to make a comeback, it would've been off the back of this. A 4K from aspas stopped the Sentinels streak and breathed a bit of life into the Leviatán attack. The play, plus subsequent 3Ks from C0M and kiNgg, put Leviatán back into the game at 10-9. A Sentinels timeout and well-coordinated setup put themselves back in the driver's seat on the way to a 13-9 victory and a series win. zekken came alive at the end of Bind and put together a star performance across the series with 65 kills. Sacy had massive impact throughout the entire series. kiNgg and aspas were the leaders for Leviatán once again, but an overall -13 first kill differential proved to be too much to overcome. The potential is there for this Leviatán roster, but the calling and teamwork seem to be out of sync at the moment. “It was definitely a weight off our shoulders,” zekken said on making it out of Group B post-match. “We played all three teams and had some difficult matches and made it out, so just happy that we could do that.” G2 defeat KRÜ in Group C rematch The third and final match of the day saw another rematch, this time in the Group C decider. G2 and KRÜ battled to join MIBR and Sentinels in the plays-ins stage. The first matchup between the teams was an extremely close three-map series, where G2 won in the final map by just two rounds. G2 started hot, opening KRÜ's map pick with a 7-2 lead as KRÜ struggled to find space to work with against the oppressive G2 combined utility. leaf bringing out the Operator threw another wrench into the attack plans of KRÜ. A Shyy 1v2 helped KRÜ bring the half back to a 7-5 scoreline. A KRÜ pistol win pushed the score to 7-7, but the comeback wasn't to be completed as G2 rocketed back out to a 13-8 victory. neT was a major component of the win for G2 as he dropped 20 kills on Cypher. Every once in a while Klaus will pull off an insane play. KRÜ had much better success on G2's map pick of Sunset, the only repeat matchup between the two teams. The Chilean roster jumped out to a 7-5 lead behind an impressive 18 kills from keznit on Chamber. G2 turned up their play to another level on their attack side, dropping just one round to secure their spot at the play-ins stage. valyn 's calling was giving KRÜ fits on rotations and defensive setups. The entire G2 team finished with a positive K/D differential across the series, although neT lead the way with 37 kills. KRÜ did not have the same success across the board, although Shyy and keznit were bright spots for the team in their two matches. “We watched the first map with KRÜ back and we thought we honestly shouldn't have won that game,” JonahP said post match. “We worked on fixing things and it was a 2-0 today as it should have been.” (Banner image by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games)"

    "cleaned_content": "Day four of the VCT China Kickoff saw FunPlus Phoenix , Dragon Ranger Gaming , and EDward Gaming advance through to the playoffs. All three teams narrowly took out their opposition in tight 2-1 victories. The day's losers in Trace Esports , Titan Esports Club , and Wolves Esports will all have a chance at redeeming themselves in the decider matchups. FPX edge out Trace 2-1 FPX started day four by continuing their habit of running unorthodox compositions, opting for a double controller Harbor, Viper on Sunset. While Trace seemed to have a handle on the game early in the first half, Life came alive in the later rounds to keep the gap close. A 7-5 first half seemed promising for Trace. However, they wouldn't hold another lead for the remainder of the map. Life's Chamber became unstoppable on the attack as FPX strung together the first five rounds before Trace could take their first in the second half. Multikills from YOU and Kai brought Trace back into the swing of things to tie up the game at 10-10, but Life's Chamber entries and Autumn 's Phoenix provided enough impact for FPX to close out the map 13-11 and take a 1-0 series lead. Trace easily brushed off the first map's result, neutralizing an FPX pistol with a thrifty win on their own map pick, Bind. In a reversal of what occurred on Sunset, Trace collected a late-half four-round streak with the help of a lineup-fuelled 1v2 from IGL heybay to end their attack with an 8-4 lead. A pistol and bonus round conversion thanks to another 1v2, this time from YOU, strengthened Trace's lead to 11-4 as heybay's men found themselves within touching distance of forcing a third map. FPX proceeded undeterred by this round deficit and forced the first timeout out of Trace at 11-6. The words of destroyeR ultimately proved fruitless as FPX adapted by shifting their play to a slow and methodical default that ended in a successful A execute. The momentum truly started to build for FPX with the introduction of the attacking Operator on Omen from BerLIN . After a grueling seven straight rounds from FPX, a second timeout was called by Trace at tie game 11-11. This time around the Trace coach provided the necessary changes to push his team across the line and end the map within regulation 13-11 and tie up the series 1-1. Even the clutches were going the way of Trace. Lotus meant Life was once again put on Chamber duty and it was the duo of Life and AAAAY that delivered for FPX. Despite losing the first pistol, FPX went on a seven-round streak before Trace could answer back. Trace maintained composure late in the half and capitalized upon messy FPX post-plants to keep the deficit close at 7-5. FPX started strong with a pistol win thanks to a quick 2k on the retake from Autumn. Trace quickly responded with a thrifty win at 10-6 and shifted the momentum of the map entirely. Trace had narrowed down the round differential to one at 10-9 before a fumbled 5v3 put FPX on map and series point at 12-9. FPX would concede one more gun round before utilizing Life's Tour de Force to win an eco and close out the series 2-1 with a 13-10 scoreline on Lotus. Life ended the series with 269 ACS and a server-high 67 kills to lead FPX to victory. FPX are the first to qualify for the VCT China Kickoff playoffs, whereas Trace have been relegated to the Group A decider match versus Nova Esports. DRG take down Titan with absurd comeback on Icebox After spoiling JDG Esports 's debut, Titan opened up the first map with an impeccable 10-2 first half on Icebox. Every man deficit encountered by Titan was responded to with a multi-kill from one of the team's multiple performing stars in Rb , Abo , and LockM . Everything seemed like smooth sailing for Titan into the playoffs until it all came crashing down in the second half. The ball started rolling for DRG with a pistol round win and bonus round conversion off the back of a 1v2 from Nicc . DRG forced the first timeout from Titan at 10-6 but unfortunately, 3water 's words did little to bring his team back into the game. A near-flawless round from DRG followed and with their coffers now flush with cash they had full control of the game. A heroic 4k from Rb allowed Titan to record their first attack side round just after losing the lead at 11-10. However, this would ultimately become a minor footnote in the story of DRG's comeback as Titan went on to lose the map 13-11. The level of play from the likes of vo0kashu , nizhaoTZH , and Nicc improved drastically in the second half with all three players ending the map with more than 20 kills. On the other hand, Titan had just two players, Rb and Abo, end the map with similar stats. Despite being one of the top performers for his squad in the first half, LockM failed to record a kill in the final 14 rounds of play. Titan moved onto their map pick, Split, hoping to brush off the disappointment of the first map and started strong with a pistol win and conversion. DRG responded in the first batch of gun rounds with the usual suspects of vo0kashu and TvirusLuke continuing to deliver. DRG found themselves ahead 6-3 before Titan was able to warm up. Opening picks from the double duelist combo of Rb and Abo meant Titan were able to hold DRG at bay and keep the half close. A 6-6 scoreline facilitated the opportunity for a strong showing once moving onto the offense with a comp that should naturally succeed at executing onto sites with both Raze and Jett. Successful first duels continued to come the way of Titan as they picked up their sixth round in a row to take a 9-6 lead before DRG responded. A thrifty win thanks to a hero buy from vo0kashu cut down Titan's momentum for a moment, however, DRG would accomplish very little for the remainder of the half. A thrifty win of their own meant Titan quickly regained control of the economy and took their chance at running away with the map in stride. DRG fell entirely flat in the final four rounds of Split as Abo ran rampant through the defense. Titan washed away any fears from the first map and evened up the series 1-1 with a convincing 13-8 on Split. In-game leader duelist Abo dropped 28 kills for Titan on Split and provided crucial opening kills for his team at every opportunity. Abo was a monster on Split. Titan took the first pistol on the decider, Bind, and looked poised to take a 4-0 lead after stealing away the bonus round before a thrifty win from DRG shifted the momentum. Thrifty wins were the name of the game throughout the series as neither team could keep a site versus Sheriffs and Stingers. Titan's next round would come once again after a thrifty, this time due to a crisp 4k from Abo, to tie things up at 4-4. Titan managed to build a 6-4 lead after a 1v3 from a renewed LockM and guaranteed an even half. DRG closed the gap in later rounds to ensure 6-6 thanks to a plethora of post-plant lineups and a Raze ultimate from TvirusLuke. LockM turned up on Bind. Titan secured another pistol and conversion on the decider courtesy of Abo's entries. The second half became a game of back-and-forth rounds as neither team could establish a solid lead. TvirusLuke's Operator provided crucial openers for DRG, a resource previously dominated by Abo. A solid hold on the B site from vo0kashu's Cypher put DRG on map and series point at 12-10. A clean round followed to put DRG on the map as the first Ascended team to make the playoffs at a Kickoff event after taking down Titan 2-1 with a 13-10 on Bind. Titan will fight against JD Gaming for a chance at making the Play-In. Abo's heroics couldn't carry Titan over the line. EDG squeak past Wolves 2-1 Regional favourites EDG made their debut in VCT China as by far the team with the most experience at international events and success in domestic competition. Prior to franchising, EDG were champions at every Evolution event and took most series in dominant fashion. On the other hand, Wolves came into the match as a mixture of rookies, with veteran player Yuicaw the only one to have touched the international stage. Wolves kept things tight in the first half and responded quickly after a pistol loss with back-and-forth gun rounds in large part due to an excellent performance from Spring 's Omen. While fan-favorite ZmjjKK was relegated to KAY/O duty, EDG could trust in the trio of CHICHOO , Haodong , and Smoggy to get work done. EDG held a narrow lead going into the second half at 7-5 but would find their attack to be a much simpler affair. Wolves would pick up just a single round versus EDG's bonus before the hometown heroes reached map point at 12-6. Spring continued to deliver to facilitate four more rounds for Wolves before fumbling an anti-eco to fall on the first map 13-10. Haodong was a saviour for EDG. Wolves moved onto their own pick, Ascent, with their heads held high after a close performance on the first map. The underdogs took the first four rounds straight with the help of a bonus round 1v2 from pl1xx . Although ZmjjKK appeared much more comfortable back on Jett, Wolves' own Jett, Spring, continued to provide dividends. Wolves accrued a 6-2 lead before EDG managed to warm up. A well-placed timeout from EDG coach AfteR brought his squad back into the swing of things and forced Wolves to look much more uncomfortable playing into EDG's Viper. EDG took the remainder of the first half rounds with ease to tie up the map at 6-6. Despite losing the pistol, Wolves immediately answered back with a thrifty win thanks to more excellent shots from Spring with a Sheriff. Wolves carried this momentum throughout the second half and dropped just a single round before hitting map point at 12-8. A stellar 1v4 ace from ZmjjKK proved to just be a delay to the inevitable as Wolves took the Ascent 13-10 to force a third map. ZmjjKK's highlights couldn't win him the map. Wolves got off to another excellent start on Breeze with a pistol win. Spring proved his development into a future superstar with a third straight top-fragging performance for his team. A timeout from EDG coach afteR at 6-1 down was the remedy EDG needed to come back into the game. ZmjjKK had fully activated by the later rounds in the first half and gave his team four more rounds before the switch to keep Breeze close at 7-5. Wolves started the second half with another pistol and a win in the first gun round to look poised to complete the upset with a 10-6 lead. The nerves may have gotten to the Wolves as CHICHOO stole a thrifty 1v2 to bring the momentum back into EDG's hands. An excellently timed KAY/O knife from Smoggy interrupted a Yoru ultimate from pl1xx handed EDG the lead for the first time on Breeze 11-10. The rounds came to EDG convincingly for the rest of the series as Haodong's squad reached map and series point at 12-10. It was only a matter of time before EDG prevented the upset to take Breeze 13-11 and the series 2-1. Wolves fumbled a thrifty to CHICHOO. Despite losing the series in heartbreaking fashion, Wolves had much to be proud of as Spring ended the series with 269 ACS. On the other hand, ZmjjKK was explosive on Breeze with 28 kills and 321 ACS on the final map. EDG could look to their multiple stars to deliver occasional hero moments from all five players. EDG have qualified for the VCT China Kickoff playoffs, while Wolves have been relegated to a decider rematch versus Bilibili Gaming ."

    "cleaned_content": "On the final VCT 2024 EMEA Kickoff group stage match day, all three matches went the distance, as Team Vitality defeated Gentle Mates 2-1, Karmine Corp beat FUT Esports 2-1, and KOI squeaked past Team Liquid 2-1 to each make it in the EMEA play-ins. The victors will compete against each other for the final playoff spot in the EMEA Kickoff, while the losers were eliminated from both the tournament and Masters Madrid. Team Vitality overcome slow start, qualify for EMEA Kickoff play-ins Game one of this triple match day for the VCT 2024 EMEA Kickoff began with Gentle Mates versus Team Vitality. The draft went as follows: Gentle Mates picked Breeze, Team Vitality picked Lotus, leaving the third map as Sunset, if needed. Breeze started out strong for Gentle Mates and never slowed down. Winning pistols and converting the bonus on their attack side, Gentle Mates lost only two rounds after, finishing the half up 10-2. A Yoru pick has proven its value in the 2024 season on maps like Bind and Breeze, as demonstrated by Jonathan \" TakaS \" Pauparda, who dropped 18 kills in the first half alone. The second half seemed to be more structured for Vitality compared to their lackluster defense, but the lead that Gentle Mates built was too much to climb. Gentle Mates took Breeze with a confident 13-4 map score. Kicks celebrates a round win at the VCT 2024 EMEA Kickoff. (Image via Team Vitality) On Lotus, their map pick, Vitality needed a repeat of their performance against FNATIC to take the series to map three, Sunset. Gentle Mates once again went with the slightly off-meta duelist pick, this time with Nathan \" nataNk \" Bocqueho on Phoenix, while Vitality ran the same team comp as their last game, with the Raze and double smokes of Omen and Viper. Rounds were traded back and forth to start the map, with Gentle Mates taking a 5-4 lead thanks to nataNk getting two calculated spam kills through Vitality's Viper ultimate. Building up his Phoenix ultimate quickly, Vitality didn't seem to have a read on how to defend the aggression of Phoenix and Breach, but a Tomas \" Destrian \" Linikas Killjoy turret 2K kept Vitality in the game at the half, only down 7-5. A pistol and anti-eco win for Team Vitality tied the series at 7-7, but a backbreaking millisecond defuse from nataNk kept Gentle Mates ahead. Thanks to some crucial duels across the map, Vitality avoided the Phoenix or punished his aggression on C site, taking the map to overtime. Their adaptations proved worth it, winning 15-13 and taking the series to Sunset. Sunset marked the return of Yoru from Gentle Mates, but the map began with a pistol that Vitality won thanks to a clutch from the duelist on Team Vitality, Emil \" runneR \" Trajkovski. A converted bonus put Gentle Mates on the back foot, down significantly for the first time in the series. They won their first round on round eight, but that proved to be all for that half, down 11-1. A pistol win meant a map and series win, with Vitality concluding the series 13-3 in one of, if not, the strongest map performances we've seen in EMEA so far. Karmine Corp topple FUT Esports in back-and-forth series The maps for the matchup between Karmine Corp and FUT Esports were Karmine Corp's pick of Lotus, FUT Esports' pick of Bind, and the decider of Sunset. To start, Lotus had some compositions that even the analyst desk didn't expect, simply because both teams had shown love for more unexpected agents, like Yoru. Instead, we got Gekko and Raze from FUT, while we got Fade and Raze from KC. Karmine Corp started off well on their attack, with Martin \" MAGNUM \" Peňkov getting a 4K on the first rifle round for both teams. Marshall \" N4RRATE \" Massey got an ace on A site, giving KC a lead, but FUT fought back using good retake protocol and smart duels mid-round, clawing the half back at tying it at 6-6.

Rounds went back and forth, eco after eco, all the way to overtime. The overtime dragged on, as KC would always win their attack to get on map point, but always lose their defense. It only got more hectic as the overtime went on, with both teams losing fights when up by one or two players. Even when FUT managed to stop KC's attack for the first time, KC finally managed to defend in overtime to extend it. In the end, KC managed to take a player advantage on defense and win the grueling OT 20-18. Heading with the series lead into Bind, Karmine Corp went back to double duelist and no sentinel, with Yoru and Raze. FUT stuck on Gekko, but with a KAYO alongside him this time. With the way the teams were built, Karmine Corp looked to have a tougher time on defense, which is how it began. KC lost multiple 1v3 scenarios on the way to a 9-3 deficit. Ata \" AtaKaptan \" Tan was hitting every shot, while Karmine Corp were putting themselves in a big hole they would have to climb out of after losing the second pistol round. It proved to be too much, as another team on this match day lost a map 13-4. Now, it would all come down to Sunset, a map that Karmine Corp showed struggles with in their game against GIANTX . The compositions were near mirrors of each other, with the one difference being Gekko on KC and Fade on FUT. First pistols went to Karmine Corp, and a bonus conversion snowballed into a 9-1 lead. Karmine Corp, much like on Lotus, were comfortable playing retake, and the mix of smart smokes from Ryad \" sh1n \" Ensaad and good utility from N4RRATE led to plenty of round wins. KC entered the half up 10-2, FUT needing a near perfect defense to avoid elimination. FUT won the second pistol, completing the first needed step for a comeback, followed by a bonus conversion, step two. As Mehmet \" cNed \" İpek tried to keep the momentum up off of some great shots, he was shot mid-ultimate to go down 11-6. Magnum and Martin \" marteen \" Pátek continued their form from the first half to help close out map three, 13-7, and the series, 2-1. It was a tough series for Karmine Corp, especially after their crushing map two, but their IGL wasn't too fazed, thanks to the prep they put into the maps before the series. “For us, [our goal] was to focus on the preparation, prepare for all the maps,” Magnum said post-match. “We managed to bounce back after Bind, and it worked out on Sunset.” Movistar KOI outlast Team Liquid in the closest series of the day The Polish trio of kamo, starxo, and grubinho from KOI. (Image via KOI) The maps were Movistar KOI's pick of Sunset, Team Liquid's pick of Icebox, leaving the decider map as Split. Sunset started with mirror compositions between the two teams: Breach, Omen, Raze, Fade, and Cypher. Pistols went in the defense's favor, towards Team Liquid, but Tobias \" ShadoW \" Flodström from KOI kept the game close early on. After a timeout, a hero Operator from Georgio \" keiko \" Sanassy turned the game on its head, giving Team Liquid the 7-5 lead at the half. KOI started the second half strong, with a flawless pistol leading into a Kamil \" kamo \" Frąckowiak ace, but Team Liquid kept the lead after more Keiko kills. It looked like Keiko had the opportunity to heat up and start tearing KOI to shreds like their previous matchup, but Grzegorz \" grubinho \" Ryczko tied it up late with a pistol 3K against full weaponry. ShadoW helped KOI take the lead late, and clutched out the map win 13-11. KOI won their map pick, meaning that Team Liquid had to win on Icebox to extend the series and avoid elimination. While Liquid's comp was a relatively standard Icebox comp with a Sova, Sage, Jett, and Killjoy, KOI decided to swap the Jett for Yoru, and the Sage for Harbor. Icebox began with Team Liquid winning pistols and converting their bonus, starting their defense off well. KOI managed to get their first round win on round five, fighting back to a tied 6-6 half. KOI won pistols to take their first lead of the map, but Team Liquid used their Sage and Killjoy to make post-plants a pain for KOI. Both teams took it to overtime, but Liquid won the first two rounds of overtime to get the map, 14-12. The third EMEA game of the day, and the third match that goes to map three, this time to Split. As for compositions, Team Liquid ran the Cypher and Skye, while KOI ran the Breach and Fade. KOI won pistols in the first half, and built a lead on defense, punctuated by a Judge 4K by Patryk \" starxo \" Kopczyński just outside B main. Just like the previous two maps, neither team could build a lead of more than three or four maps, with KOI heading into the half up 7-5. Getting the pistol, KOI had an opportunity to run away with the map, even converting the bonus to go up 10-5. Team Liquid then used some clutch moments from Ayaz \" nAts \" Akhmetshin to prevent KOI from getting to that series point, tying it at 10-10. The five consecutive rounds from Team Liquid looked like they were running away with the game, but KOI suddenly turned the game on its head, winning the final three rounds to win 13-10 and the series 2-1. The revenge was complete, with KOI eliminating the team that sent them down to the decider match. After not only getting that revenge, but also beating some of his ex-teammates from 2023, ShadoW was glad that they got this win when it mattered most, heading into play-ins. “It was an amazing feeling to close this out,” ShadoW said post-match. “We should have closed them out last time, but we did it now. It's good to be the underdog, play with no pressure and just play our game.”"

    "cleaned_content": "Gen.G have extended their upset streak with a 3-1 victory over Paper Rex . As the Pacific Kickoff winners, they have earned a top seed for Masters: Madrid and three Championship Points for Champions 2024 qualification. The two teams previously met in the Group C Winner's match, looking to earn a spot in the Kickoff playoffs. Also a close series, Paper Rex was able to close out the score 2-1. The loss meant Gen.G was forced to qualify through the play-ins, playing every possible match their schedule offered to reach this stage. Gen.G set the pace on Ascent The match began on Ascent, Gen.G's map pick. They went into the map with the standard team comp, while Paper Rex kept the same double controller, double initiator they had picked previously. A pacey push from Paper Rex gave them the pistol round, and a similar attack followed for round 2. Back-to-back quad kills from t3xture gave the Korean team the lead, and forced a timeout from the opposing coach, alecks . Gen.G continued extending their lead. It wasn't until round 8 that Paper Rex started fighting back, switching their offense to B. The new plan worked out, but it was too little, too late for the half, as the Korean squad's lead set the score 7-5. Munchkin's mid lurk helps win the round The second half was not close. Gen.G seemed ready for every idea Paper Rex had, and using up both of their pauses in the first half benefitted the Korean squad greatly. Munchkin's lurking through mid helped win a couple of rounds, but t3xture continued being the top performer for his team. He ended the attack with an 11/2 KD, and totalled a 1.59 rating for the map. Karon, who was crucial for their defense, was close behind, with a 1.49 rating. Paper Rex bounce back with their triple duelist comp Five out of ten agents picked on Split were duelists. Paper Rex continued their triple duelist from their match against T1, and Meteor returned to Jett. The South East Asian representatives gave an attacking masterclass. A brute force onto B site gave them the bonus, and they continued their streak. Mirroring Paper Rex on map one, Gen.G coach solo saw the need to use his team's second timeout early. forsakeN shows off his Yoru expertise Round 7 came down to the wire, but Gen.G was able to leverage their player advantage to get their first round win. Down to a half buy, something found three to win them the round. Gen.G answered with their own half buy win, finding their second round. The half ended 8-4, setting up Paper Rex for a comfortable defense. The pistol came down to a 1v2 from f0rsakeN , and it was all downhill from there for Gen.G. Identifying their opponent's weak economy, Paper Rex went for a double Outlaw setup, functionally an Operator for the remaining five rounds of the map. Together, Paper Rex's triple duelist earned them 11 first kills, compared to Gen.G's total of five. The Jetts' performance was night-and-day, with something ending the map on a 1.30 rating and 6/1 first kills against Meteor's 0.55 rating and a 0/4 first kill to first death ratio. Gen.G halt Paper Rex's comeback Returning to a Gen.G map pick, Lotus saw something 's first Reyna of the year. The Korean team took an early lead, continuing the game's trend of teams winning their bonus round. Paper Rex found the next five rounds, working the map to their advantage and regulating their aggression appropriately. Gen.G were able to tie the map in the second half, setting the score at 7-7 after the pistol and anti-eco. Paper Rex won the bonus, down to a 2v1, followed by a Gen.G round win that prompted a timeout from their opponents. Paper Rex guessed correctly for their A gamble stack, but their eco was no match to Gen.G's rifles. Keeping t3xture in check The back-and-forth continued. Paper Rex broke their opponent's Viper's Pit post-plant, only to be answered by Munchkin stealing t3xture's ace the next round. Eventually, Gen.G reached match point, a string of unlikely wins from Paper Rex almost closing the gap. In the end a quick entry into B sealed the deal, giving Gen.G a 13-11 win on their map. The upset is completed on Bind The fourth map, Bind, was a strong start for Gen.G, winning the first four rounds of the half. The new setting saw them pick up the pace for their offense, with few rotations and committing to sites within the first 40 seconds of every round. Taking advantage of their proactivity, a triple kill from mindfreak granted his team their first round, but they only won three rounds afterwards. Those four rounds would be the last that Paper Rex would win. Lakia won a 1v1 in the pistol round, and the controller duo easily cleaned up the anti-eco. Confident as ever, Gen.G continued to “out-aggress” the aggressors, pushing out of B in their bonus and finishing Paper Rex off in seconds. A half buy was nearly successful, but double eliminations from Meteor and Karon dealt with the push. A read and early aggression win the bonus The final round of the final was a myriad of trades, but once again it was Karon who helped win the round. With only a classic in hand, he anticipated Paper Rex's teleport rotation, killing something and bringing Monyet down to 33 hp. That ended up being enough damage to hand t3xture the clutch on a silver platter. “I couldn't even dream about being a champion,” t3xture said after the match. “I've just been playing VCT because I really love the game,” he said. “I just can't believe it.” Munchkin and HSK attributed their success to the coaching staff. “My coaching staff really believed in [my direction], and actually molded me and my direction into a title win” the in-game leader said. “We knew we had all the right players, however there was just something missing”, HSK added. “Once we got solo as head coach, I started to feel we just can't lose a match.”"

    "cleaned_content": "After a turbulent offseason and only two returning players, Evil Geniuses debuted in the Group C Winners match with a 2-0 victory over G2 Esports . G2 will have a rematch with KRÜ Esports in the decider match, where the winner will go on to the play-ins stage. The series kicked off on G2's pick of Sunset. G2 looked poised for an early victory after a resounding 7-0 start in their attacking half. Using both of their timeouts, Evil Geniuses rallied back their half 8-4 with solid teamwork and a lifeline to bring the game back. EG opened the second half with wins on pistol, anti-eco, and the post-bonus gun rounds, but G2 climbed to an 11-7 lead, two rounds from certain victory. Round 19 was when the scales started to favor Evil Geniuses, beginning with a 1v2 clutch from in-game leader NaturE . The following rounds were a display of unity amongst the new Evil Geniuses, as they left G2 confused, especially after a 2v5 from Derrek and NaturE in round 22, tying the game 11-11. Two more rounds later, the game went on to overtime. The clutch that set the comeback in motion. An ice-cold outplay-defuse from NaturE gave EG an edge in overtime, but a solid retake by G2 tied the game once more. Evil Geniuses then closed out the map and earned their first win in 2024. Despite being on the losing side, leaf had a solid performance – racking up a 24-21 KD and 264 ACS. The rest of Evil Geniuses all had a greater FK-FD ratio than all the G2 players, aside from valyn . Evil Geniuses entered their pick of Icebox with a rather unusual composition: a zero duelist Deadlock and Gekko comp, with jawgemo on the former. The comp seemed effective as EG opened the first half 4-1. After a timeout, G2 relented with back-and-forth rounds, but their opponents got the 7-5 lead at halftime. G2 stormed out the gates in the final half and won five out of six rounds, bringing the game 10-8. Round 19 once again let Evil Geniuses regain momentum as Apoth started to light up the kill feed. Following a clever postplant setup from Jawgemo and NaturE, G2's JonahP gave his team a fighting chance, ending round 21 with an ace. With nailbiting series on their hands, potter rallied her troops back with a timeout and set them up for success as the young returnee Apoth continued to break G2's defenses lurk after lurk. One round away from victory, Evil Geniuses took their time in deciding which site was clear. With 20 seconds left, Apoth's Lockdown let EG push onto A site, but valyn's early kill onto the Killjoy and his Incendiary left only seven seconds on the board. A tense 1v2 ensued as supamen activated his Viper's Pit, and his Snakebites left G2 in the dust and secured the 2-0 victory. Seconds to spare, and 1v2 to dare. New kids on the block Apoth and supamen dismantled G2 with incredible lurks. Each had 13 kills in their attack half, and more than anyone on G2 individually. Once again, leaf shone through as the only positive player in KDA and had a higher rating than everyone but supamen. When asked about the new core's synergy and restructuring, jawgemo basically summed up Evil Geniuses' \"downfall\". \"We have nothing to lose, you know, people praying on our downfall, this is just another year of EG getting a downfall. Me and potter knew whatever team we could pull together, we can make it work.\" The confidence was another factor for EG's victory, and jawgemo knew how to set his boys up. \"We're just gonna play as confident as we can, 'cause you guys can see the shooters on our team now.\" Evil Geniuses move on to the playoffs, where they await NRG , LOUD , or the play-in winner."

    "cleaned_content": "The first two teams have been eliminated from the Champions Tour 2024: China Kickoff after Nova Esports topped TYLOO and JDG Esports bested All Gamers . Both matches ended 2-0, although three of the day's four maps went a full 24 rounds. Nova Esports and JD Gaming now get to fight another day for a chance to make the play-ins that could be either team's ticket to the four-team playoff to decide the China Kickoff champions. TYLOO and All Gamers, meanwhile, are the first two teams in the tournament to suffer elimination. Nova Esports outlasts TYLOO in a close 2-0 TYLOO began the day with an Ascent pick and an opening half on defense, a promising setup to open the day considering the map's defensive tilt. They used that potential early advantage to score the first three rounds, appearing to give themselves the early momentum. That was not the case in reality, however, as Nova rebounded for five consecutive rounds that they turned into an early 7-5 lead by halftime. TYLOO eventually fought back to a 10-10 tie during their attacking half, setting up for a close final few rounds to decide the map. Nova gave themselves a 12-11 advantage, which they soon converted into victory in just about the closest possible manner any team could manage. The attacking TYLOO squad executed onto B-site late into the final round, giving themselves less than 20 seconds to win the round and force overtime. Their hit seemed successful as they built a numbers advantage over Nova. With two seconds remaining in the round, TYLOO had a 4v2 advantage over Nova while LuoK1ng attempted to stick the plant. TYLOO's zjc killed OBONE , but he and his team secured things just a tick too late. LuoK1ng didn't complete his plant until after time expired and Ninebody eliminated Nova's final survivor, GuanG , moments after the clock hit zero. TYLOO would have liked to have given themselves one more second on that site hit. Nova carried the momentum from that victory into Split to again build an early lead, eventually building themself a five-round cushion with a 10-5 lead. TYLOO fought back to bring things within one at 12-11, but Nova seemed to have had enough of letting the match drag out at this point. PangH rushed out of Garage with his Showstopper ultimate out the moment the round 24 started. He chased down the attackers, missing his ultimate on them, before managing a quick two kills with his Spectre. His teammates quickly collapsed on the TYLOO players herded toward them by the Raze ultimate, making it 5v1 seconds into the start of the round. It was only a matter of time before Nova found AAK and sealed up the match in their favor. Nova had no interest in relying on the clock to win another map. Despite winning 2-0, Nova trailed TYLOO in kills by two over the course of the match and TYLOO's Ninebody had the highest ACS in the match. Nova Esports advances to the decider round of the group stage, where they will play the loser of Trace Esports and FunPlus Phoenix. Their decider match is scheduled for Feb. 26. JD Gaming defeat All Gamers 2-0 The next match started similarly as the first — the team that picked the first map and opened by winning the pistol ultimately fell short to their opponents. This time, that unfortunate team was All Gamers, who had picked Icebox and took the first two rounds of the game. In another echo of the opening match, JD Gaming turned their fortunes around with victories in five straight rounds to enter the second half with a 7-5 lead. The back-and-forth nature of that subsequent half ultimately worked in JD's advantage, who turned a 7-5 into a 13-11 victory. And, to further illustrate the parallels between the day's first match and its second, All Gamers lost the map despite building a significant advantage in kills. All Gamers earned nine more kills than JD, largely off the back of a 28-16 performance from bunt on Viper. The next map, Sunset, finally parted from the day's trends. It started close enough; JD and All Gamers regularly traded rounds and entered halftime tied 6-6. All Gamers even managed to take a small lead by winning the first two rounds of the second half. But those two rounds were the last All Gamers would win at the VCT China Kickoff. JD won the next seven rounds, completely shutting down All Gamer's offense to pull away for an easy victory. They, too, appeared to have no interest in winning the match off of the timer, as MarT1n pushed out of A site to get a 4K and wipe All Gamers in the early seconds of round 24. That's just the kind of half it was for All Gamers. For once, the scoreboard was dominated by the winning team. Viva led the server on Sunset with a 20-7 KD, and not a single member of his team finished with a negative kill difference. Their dominant performance was enough to give them a healthy lead in kills across the entire match, finishing +15 between the two maps. JD Gaming, like Nova, will play in a decider match on Feb. 26. Their match will be against the losers of a bout between Titan Esports Club and Dragon Ranger Gaming."

PRX now advances to the grand finals awaiting the winners of Gen.G vs. DRX , while T1 has to swallow in a 3rd-4th place finish. Meanwhile, Gen.G has qualified for their second VCT international LAN by beating DRX 2-0 in the second Semifinals match of Pacific Kickoff. Gen.G will meet Paper Rex in the grand finals while DRX is eliminated from Kickoff. Battle of brothers: Paper Rex claim victory against T1 The battle between the Susanto brothers f0rsakeN and xccurate was one of the primary focal points of the series, along with Paper Rex's international LAN appearance streak being in jeopardy. Starting out on Split which was PRX's pick, the Pacific giants pulled out another rabbit out of their many agent compositions: a three-Duelist lineup with Monyet on Raze, something on Jett, and f0rsakeN on Yoru. Even with the fastball thrown by PRX, T1 started out strong with an 8-4 lead, with PRX not being able to stymie the clinical approach of T1 at the first half off the back of strong performances from iZu , Rossy , and Sayaplayer giving PRX no room to breathe. PRX was able to won the following pistol round and the following anti-eco, resulting in one of the International League's fastest round, clocking around 15 seconds. There, PRX continue to build up their lead with a 7-round streak, before T1 clawing back and answer with 4 of their own. With their backs against the wall, PRX dug deep and through kills from mindfreak , d4v41 , and f0rsakeN, PRX brought it to overtime. A tense back and forth affair ensued, and PRX inched out at the end to win Split. Fifteen seconds — blink and you'll miss it. Moving on to Ascent, PRX started by flipping the script T1 had on Split. While T1 was able to win the opening pistol round, PRX won the eco, and string 6 in a row, leading to a 8-4 score line on the first half, including an ace from d4v41 on Round 6. T1 was able to win another pistol round, but PRX intended to end them right there and then. PRX finished the deal and won 13-6 on Bind, with f0rsakeN ending up on top of the scoreboard with 1.52 rating, 286 ACS, and 21 kills, totaling in a whopping 54 kills across the two maps. With their win, PRX now advances to the grand finals of Pacific Kickoff and secured another international appearance in Masters Madrid as the first Pacific team to do so and across the four International Leagues. Gen.G rise as DRX fall The two Korean teams battled across two maps, starting with DRX's map pick, Split. It was a relatively standard affair, with DRX leading the half 7-5. DRX was looking to end the match quick with a 12-8 scoreline, but Gen.G managed to string a round-win streak to send the map into OT, where Gen.G capitalized on their momentum and sent a statement by winning 14-12. 2 HP? No problem. By the time Lotus start, Gen.G's momentum was in full swing. All Gen.G members were firing on all cylinders as they ended their half with a 9-3 lead. Desperate, while DRX managed to retaliate back with 5 rounds in the second half in a back and forth affair, Gen.G sealed their fate, winning Lotus in a 13-8 victory, sending waves to the entire community. Gen.G have booked their first Masters appearance while DRX have failed to secure their sixth consecutive appearance on an international stage, marking their second Masters miss ever after their loss to NUTURN in 2021."

    "cleaned_content": "EMEA powerhouses Natus Vincere and FNATIC have punched a ticket to the Kickoff playoffs following 2-0 victories against Team Liquid and Team Vitality . They are now one match away from qualifying to Masters Madrid , and await an opponent following the playoffs draw. KOI is one of their possible rivals, with a 2-0 defeat of BBL Esports keeping them alive in the tournament. Team Liquid and KOI next play against each other in the Group B Decider. The winner of that series will then go to the Play-In stage , and the top team will join NAVI, Team Heretics, and FNATIC in playoffs. Likewise, Team Vitality face a rematch against Ascension winners Gentle Mates, where the victor will also advance to the Play-In stage. NAVI sweep Team Liquid with clean 2-0 The veto gave first pick to Team Liquid, who chose Split to kick off the match. NAVI selected Breeze, confident since their 13-6 win against BBL. Ascent remained as the final map. The map started in fairly standard fashion, with ardiis and Zyppan granting their team the pistol round. They won the anti-eco, and Team Liquid took the bonus. Two more rounds for NAVI followed, putting them at a 4-1 lead. For round six, Mistic teleported into NAVI's spawn, and they were none the wiser. This let him find two eliminations to stop a retake, and Team Liquid won another offense round. They were able to better justify their map selection in the following round, turning the score around and taking the lead 5-4. The half ended 7-5 in Team Liquid's favor, setting them up for a favorable defense, the side on which the team has been more comfortable in the past SUYGETSU finds three to win the pistol Refreshed from halftime, SUYGETSU opened the second half with a triple kill. NAVI continued on to not lose a single round. There weren't necessarily any individual heroics; every team member contributed equally. The winning streak meant Liquid was on the back foot economically, only being able to full buy on two rounds in the second half. NAVI ultimately won Split 13-7. Continuing on Breeze, the pistol round came down to a 1v1 between Jamppi and ardiis. The NAVI player was low on health, and Jamppi finished him off. The next round saw a failed set play with ardiis's Yoru, hindered by his team's lack of rifles. He redeemed himself with back to back clutches, and NAVI went on to win the next three rounds. Team Liquid responded with four round wins, aided by triple kills from Mistic and nAts . In the end, NAVI evened things out with a final offensive round, tying the score 6-6. The second half of Breeze mirrored map one. NAVI got off to a strong start and was clearly the more dominant team in the half. Team Liquid found a consolation round, but NAVI's defense was too difficult to crack otherwise. Zyppan stepped up for his team, getting four multikills across the half, putting him at 16 eliminations in their defense. He ended the map with a 1.51 rating, the highest in the server. ardiis and Zyppan expertly coordinate a retake “They're a new roster,” NAVI coach d00mbr0s commented after the match. “As maps go on, the experience shows,” he added. This series marks the fourth time the two have met since the beginning of the VCT partnership, and the third time NAVI has come out on top. Historically, this game has been one of EMEA's flagship matchups. The NAVI core (previously on FunPlus Phoenix ) and Team Liquid have faced off on 14 occasions, with Liquid only winning twice. KOI earn rematch against Team Liquid with 2-0 win The second match of the day would determine the first team eliminated from Group B. Both teams were hoping to redeem themselves after a poor 2023, with BBL Esports ending league play in 7th place and KOI in 9th. The series began on Bind, where BBL had recently defeated NAVI. The two teams opted for slightly modified versions of the classic comp. BBL went with a second flash initiator with pAura 's Breach, while KOI put ShadoW on Fade. KOI started off with a 4-0 lead on their opponent's map. Once the economy equalized on round five, BBL scored their first point. This did little for their hopes at a comeback, as KOI ended up winning the half 10-2. ShadoW ends a 4k with a clutch After the half, BBL were able to win a close pistol round to extend their stay. They took two more rounds, including KOI's bonus, forcing them onto a half buy. grubinho kept a hero Vandal, and kamo was tasked with leading a cautious site take with his Sheriff. After losing the first kill to reazy , the Polish duo were able to find two picks each for a thrifty win. BBL then called for a timeout, but KOI won the final two rounds of the map, winning Bind 13-5. Map two was Split, KOI's choice during the veto. BBL entered the map winning the pistol round and showed a fair defense half. Elite continued his good form from Bind, helping mitigate kamo's entries. It would not be enough, however, since kamo led his team to win six rounds on their attack. KOI switch to a pacier attack to finish the half For their own offense, the Turkish team attempted a force buy after losing the pistol. It almost paid off, but they were unable to finish off ShadoW, dying to him as they attempted to enter into B. BBL did win round 16 after their economy settled, but KOI remained unfazed. In the end, KOI won the map 13-10, despite BBL's best efforts at closing rounds out. Ahead of the rematch against Team Liquid, starxo was confident about their chances. “What made us lose, some problems we already fixed,” he reflected about their previous meeting. “We're just gonna win it on Sunday.” FNATIC win first of two matches needed to go to Madrid. The Group C Winner's match featured FNATIC, who earned a bye due to their 2023 performance, and Team Vitality, who earned their place in the upper bracket after defeating Gentle Mates. This meant FNATIC had more recent footage on their opponents, but Vitality could go into the match with the momentum of a 2-0. The map veto was a lose-lose situation for the French org. The maps that remained after the bans were Lotus, a map FNATIC has only lost twice, Ascent, a map where FNATIC have bested the likes of DRX and LOUD, and Bind, arguably their most iconic map and where FNATIC had set the standard for every other team since before being FNATIC. Undeterred, they entered Lotus with an early lead, up 3-1 to start. An aggressive thrifty and cautious anti-eco from FNATIC put them on even footing, and they carried that momentum to an additional five round wins. Boaster's aggression pays off Despite Sayf 's best efforts, FNATIC ended the half 8-4. He ended the half with a 17/8 KD and 1.63 rating, but the rest of the team failed to keep up. His controller partner, ceNder , opened the second half with a triple, gifting his team the pistol. They shut down a proactive eco outside C, and returned to the site for a bonus round win off the back of a Kicks 4k. Identifying a weakness, they once again finished on C, but paid too much respect to FNATIC's eco round and lost to time. Alfajer extended their lead with a blind triple kill on B. Following that win, a back-and-forth ensued, lasting until round 21. FNATIC were now on match point, and Vitality needed heroics to recover. Sayf and Destrian shut down a flank to win a half-buy round, followed by a clean plant on an empty B site. Kicks put the cherry on top with an Odin triple kill, sending map one into overtime. Only two short rounds were played outside regulation, as FNATIC easily picked apart Vitality's defense and attempted attack. FNATIC were now one map away from playoffs. Team Vitality continued their pistol round streak, and found the opening kill on round two, but Derke and Alfajer won them the round. Vitality then accelerated their offense to find another two rounds. Their opponents were happy to oblige, confident enough in their retakes to let Vitality enter sites. For the final two rounds, runneR and Sayf helped their team win a thrifty, while Kicks brought back the Odin to recover a 3v5. An Odin denies the ace for the second time in the map Chronicle won a 1v2 clutch on round 13, earning FNATIC's first pistol round. He repeated the feat on round 15, breaking the rival economy. By now confidence was built up for the two-time LAN winners. An unassisted push from Derke and perfect timing from Boaster won them the last two rounds of the map. “This year we're going for all three,” Boaster said. “You'll just have to wait and see what we have been cooking.”"

    "cleaned_content": "NRG took down Cloud9 in two maps to start the day for Americas, and LOUD defeated LEVIATÁN in a three map thriller to become the first teams to qualify for the VCT Americas Kickoff playoffs stage . NRG handle C9 to become first Americas Kickoff playoff team To begin the VCT Americas day, Cloud9 took the series to Sunset. Cloud9 played the map six times during their busy offseason, winning five times. It would be the NRG's debut on the map, however they looked right at home jumping out to a 8-4 halftime lead off the back of Ethan and Demon1 's dominating Operator play. NRG placing Demon1 on Jett, the first time a team had picked the agent across all of the VCT Kickoffs so far, proved to be too much for Cloud9. Despite wippie 's best attempts to slow the rampaging duelist down, NRG closed C9's map pick out with a comfortable 13-7 win. \"I don't care.\" - Demon1 when asked who he wants to play. He certainly plays like it. jakee helped Cloud9 stabilize at the start of Ascent, but Victor and Marved answered by dropping a combined 25 kills to cover for Demon1 and Ethan's slow start of just five combined kills. NRG's constant mid control and split attacks on the bomb sites allowed them to manage five rounds on the tougher side of Ascent A second Victor pistol clutch set NRG for six straight rounds for their defensive side, procuring a 11-7 lead where it appeared Cloud9 was dead in the water. A few decisive site executions and a critical vanity and wippie 2v4 gave C9 four rounds in a row of their own to bring Ascent to a 11-11 stalemate. vanity is currently tied with aspas for the most clutches in Americas Kickoff with 5. After a miraculous Demon1 Operator 3K in round 23, a hit off the back of the Xeppaa KAY/O ultimate helped secure overtime for Cloud9 in round 24. Overtime was headlined by the defensive pushes into the main areas on Ascent with C9 failing at their push and NRG clinching both the map and series off of their own. Demon1 finished with 43 kills for the highest mark in the lobby, 20 of them Operator kills. Each member of NRG's squad finished with a higher rating than any of the Cloud9 players. vanity and OXY were the bright spots for Cloud9, with OXY converting 9 first bloods on Ascent alone. NRG will wait until next Saturday to play for a Madrid appearance in the playoffs stage, while Cloud9 will rematch MIBR for a play-ins spot on Sunday. When asked why NRG will make it to Masters Madrid post-match, Demon1 had just this to say: “We have five champs.” LOUD survive Leviatán in aspas' first meetup with old team The second and final match of the day brought drama and storylines. The return of aspas to face off against his former teammates on LOUD would come just two matches into each of their respective seasons, and with the chance to play for a spot at Madrid on the line. Leviatán selected Bind as their map selection, where both teams introduced peculiar compositions into the equation. The third-place Champions 2023 finishers went with Breach + KAY/O along with putting their new duelist ambitioN onto Phoenix. Leviatán brought out their Harbor/Viper/Gekko picks that they used against 100 Thieves. If the newly-formed Leviatán lineup was feeling any pressure, they certainly did not show it. The mixed Americas squad showed impressive individual skills, played patiently, and hit the right site on attack time and time again as LOUD played passively right into their hands. Despite a few timely flanks from LOUD at the end of the half, the clinical Leviatán attack put together a 9-3 lead on attack. Leviatán managed a plant on all twelve of their attack rounds. kiNgg owns this A short area on Bind. The Brazilian squad flipped the map on its head to begin their own attack side, using their heavy flash comp to delay on the post-plant over and over again to bring themselves back into the game at 9-8. Leviatán would answer with more coordinated plays on defense and map control to reach map point. LOUD would gain a few more to push the map to the conclusive round 24 which saw five ultimates used but a flawless round for Leviatán. Of the 24 rounds, 22 of them saw the spike planted, but just five defuses. What had begun as a clean win for Leviatán finished as an all-out utility barrage brawl of a match. kiNgg and tex were the pillars contributing to the win, with the latter picking up seven first bloods. This is where Split really started to get wild. After LOUD's opening pistol round win, kiNgg proved to be a lurking menace on Split attack. The A site Viper wall enabled the IGL to find picks and cause trouble for the LOUD defense. LOUD answered with shutting down the Leviatán hits on A and retaking nearly flawlessly to bring Split back to a 6-6 halftime score. The second half of Split was pandemonium in full. A LOUD 2v5 pistol, a kiNgg 4K, an aspas 1v2, and an insane LOUD eco all occurred in the first eight rounds of the second half. At the end of it all, LOUDs +10 first blood differential and post plants were too much for Leviatán to surmount, culminating in a 13-10 LOUD victory. Aspas had no right to win this round from his position. Split was the Viper playground, with Less and kiNgg combining for 45 kills and just 26 deaths. The final map of Ascent saw LOUD reuse their Phoenix/Breach/Viper composition which troubled the Leviatán defense greatly, setting LOUD up with a large lead. The walls, flashes, and smokes took control of the map repeatedly while Leviatán could hardly find a sliver of space to work with. Aspas found no value with the Operator, and C0M was the only LEV player with double digit kills. Facing a 9-3 deficit at the half, it appeared that Leviatán might wilt completely, but winning a pistol provided a bit of hope. It wasn't to be however, as saadhak and cauanzin brought out the shotguns to bring back some of the scrappiness from Split to secure the series win for LOUD. Less was the hero for LOUD across the entire series, putting up a 1.5 rating and a 61-33 kill-death ratio. The entirety of LOUD want +18 in first kill differential in the series. kiNgg was the lone bright spot for Leviatán, as the only player with a positive rating in the series. LOUD joins NRG as the two current teams in the playoffs stage next weekend, while Leviatán will play Sentinels for a spot in the play-ins stage. “People cannot underestimate us,” qck said post-match. “We are very flexible, and we have a lot to show.”"

    "cleaned_content": "Titan Esports Club , Dragon Ranger Gaming , and Wolves Esports all walked away with wins after the second day of the VCT China Kickoff . Titan and DRG will face off for a direct spot in the playoffs, while Wolves will play regional heavyweights EDward Gaming for that same privilege. The day's losers in JDG Esports , All Gamers , and Bilibili Gaming have found themselves one series away from elimination. Rb's Titan spoils JDG debut JD Gaming had entered franchising with the signing of the majority of the coveted Rare Atom roster that placed second in Ascension China . However, the organization was forced to choose between star duelist stew and in-game leader yoman to comply with import restrictions with both players hailing from South Korea. As a result, yoman was dropped to make way for Hong Kong player jkuro , formerly of Top Esports. Titan Esports Club made their debut with a squad comprised of the core the organization previously fielded in the Evolution Series with the notable additions of LockM from Night Wings Gaming and international veteran Rb from DRX . JDG got off to a red-hot start on Lotus with stew proving why he deserved to be re-signed with multikills aplenty. A 6-3 lead for JDG on the attack ensued before Titan began to pick up the pace. Titan proceeded to go on a nine-round streak, completely flattening JDG to hit map point and lead 12-6. Despite stew's server topping 24 kills, JDG appeared deflated and mustered just two rounds before Titan took the lead in the series with a 13-8 map victory. stew's heroics weren't enough for JDG. While stew was the only player to find a positive K/D on the first map for JDG, Titan could look toward the trio of kawaii , QiuYe , and Rb to deliver results. The trio ended the game each with ACS scores greater than all of JDG aside from stew. Bind started similarly to Lotus with JDG taking another comfortable lead in the half but this time guaranteed themselves an advantage heading onto their attack with an 8-4 scoreline. JDG's play was once again spearheaded by an excellent performance from stew. Another late-game streak of rounds from Titan followed as Rb's squad acquired a 10-8 lead before JDG could pick up their first offensive round. Despite Titan narrowly making it to match point first at 12-11, a 1v3 clutch from Viva forced overtime. JDG struck first before an ace from Rb evened up the map at 13-13. Both teams proceeded to trade blows before a second overtime ace, this time coming from Abo , gave Titan the necessary momentum to once again complete a comeback and close out the map 16-14 and the series 2-0. Rb's redemption arc has begun. Titan could thank Abo and Rb for their opening win, with the pair recording 28 and 26 kills respectively on the final map while also providing an ace each in overtime to close out Bind. Although JDG may have taken a loss, stew put up an admirable performance with 59 kills across the series, 17 ahead of runner-up Rb. Titan will proceed to the winners match of Group B and are one series away from the playoffs, while JDG have been relegated to the elimination match. Abo gifted Titan a second ace in overtime. vo0kashu continues domination with win over All Gamers VCT Ascension China 2023 champions Dragon Ranger Gaming made their debut with a 2-0 win over All Gamers. Russian sentinel vo0kashu has continued to impress within the Chinese scene and was the driving force behind his team's success. DRG have made two roster changes since Ascension with Singaporean Zeno being dropped and YuChEn moving from a playing to a coaching position. The former has been replaced by FunPlus Phoenix player nizhaoTZH . All Gamers have assembled a mixture of players hailing from various teams in the Chinese scene with bunt and monk from Attacking Soul Esports , Indonesian deLb from 17Gaming , former assistant coach for EDward Gaming sword9 , and former Rare Atom substitute Spitfires . DRG started off strong on Sunset with a pistol win and anti-eco conversion but faltered in the coming gun rounds. A slow start from vo0kashu gave way to a 7-3 lead for All Gamers before DRG could fully activate. A comeback ensued in the second half as DRG looked much more comfortable on the offense with vo0kashu being given room to thrive. The Russian star provided 27 kills to close the map 13-11 for his team, despite significant competition from Bunt who dropped 28 kills of his own in the map loss. vo0kashu provided high-impact kills throughout Sunset. DRG operated as a well-oiled machine on their own map pick, Ascent, with the entire squad stepping up alongside vo0kashu. TvirusLuke provided consistent multi-kills and openers that were successfully capitalized upon by DRG. All Gamers were never able to string together rounds in the first half as the momentum only continued to build for DRG as the Ascension champs cruised to a 9-3 half. This deficit proved to be too much for All Gamers as they could muster just a single round in the second half as DRG ended the series 2-0 in dominant fashion with a 13-4 win on Ascent. All Gamers were simply never able to show up on the final map. TvirusLuke provided multiple highlights across Ascent. DRG have made it to the Group B winners match and will face off against Titan Esports Club for a spot in the playoffs, while All Gamers have been relegated to an elimination matchup against JD Gaming. Wolves decimates hope for BLG redemption with 2-0 BLG made a splash on the international scene with back-to-back wins over NRG at Champions 2023 earning themselves a playoff berth and top eight finish at the most prestigious event in the Valorant calendar. However, they have since been unable to replicate this success versus domestic competition, regularly falling far from trophy contention in the Evolution Series. BLG have opted to sign former NTER in-game leader B3ar in place of rin ahead of the regular season in an attempt to remedy these results. Wolves Esports are relatively new to the Valorant scene with an entirely new roster signed for their induction into VCT China. FunPlus Phoenix veteran Yuicaw is joined by balua from Monarch Effect , Australian pl1xx from Weibo Gaming , Spring from Ninjas In Pyjamas , and coldfish from TOP Esports . Wolves started off Ascent with pure domination as pl1xx's KAY/O ran rampant throughout the map. BLG proved incapable of stringing together consecutive rounds, while the momentum continued to build for Wolves. A pistol round win and failed second-round force out of Wolves provided a modicum of hope for BLG, however, the lead built up by Wolves seemed insurmountable as two excellent entries from Spring resulted in the map win 13-9. pl1xx was a force to be reckoned with a server-high 284 ACS and 21 kills and despite Spring's overall poor performance, the Taiwanese Jett delivered the two most crucial kills to swing the final round in Wolves' favour. Wolves moved onto their map pick, Icebox, with a 1-0 series lead and took an explosive start with a 1v2 pistol win from COLDFISH. BLG stabilized in the gun rounds before a thrifty win off the back of a slow B take tied up the game at 3-3. Back-to-back 3k's followed from pl1xx to return the lead to Wolves at 5-4. Wolves carried this slight boost to end the half narrowly ahead with a 7-5 scoreline. A second pistol win and bonus round conversion from Wolves extended their lead to 10-5. A near-flawless defense ensued for Wolves as BLG were unable to find an answer for the slower defensive playstyle their opponents presented. Wolves found themselves on map and series point at 12-5 before BLG managed to take their first attacking round. A double-kill opener from pl1xx with the Judge provided enough relief for Wolves to close out the map with a comfortable 13-7 scoreline and the series 2-0. The rookie pl1xx and veteran Yuicaw brought Wolves a 2-0 victory. Wolves will play EDward Gaming in the Group C winners match for a spot in the playoffs. BLG await the losers of the aforementioned match in the Group C decider and are one series away from elimination."

    "cleaned_content": "In the second day of Group A play in the EMEA Kickoff event, Team Heretics advanced to the playoffs over Karmine Corp , and FUT Esports eliminated GIANTX to stay alive. An array of blowout maps may have dampened the excitement, but the matches set up huge stakes for the rest of the event. Heretics decimate KCorp Heretics and KCorp formed new rosters and battled in the offseason, and Heretics were dominated at their own event. This time around, Heretics were hungry for revenge. Back-to-back 13-4 victories sent them to the playoffs of Kickoff, just one win away from an international berth. The Boo brothers once again lit up the scoreboard, but it was a complete and dominant team effort by the team with a substitute player. Heretics had all the reads on Split. They maneuvered into defensive stacks wherever KCorp wanted to go and completely shut down any aggression. In contrast, Heretics walked into completely open sites on the first two rounds of their own attack. MiniBoo dominated the server with as many multikills as all of KCorp combined to go along with a perfect 5-0 opening kill record. Heretics easily converted their opponent's map pick 13-4. Shutdown. Despite a dominant showing from KCorp on Lotus earlier in the group, Heretics still picked into it. KCorp started their attack with a quick 4-1 start, but then the defensive adjustments came through from Heretics, and the attackers got no more rounds. Heretics took Rubble control early which allowed them to rotate their players to defend the other side of the map while funneling their opponents, and KCorp never broke open that setup. Last gasp from KCorp. Heretics did not let their foot off the gas as they ran away with a second straight 13-4. MAGNUM finished with zero kills in an absolute dud of a performance both individually and as an IGL. With the win, Heretics secured a top-four berth in the playoffs, one win away from a miraculous first international appearance. A homeground “international” debut from the Spanish organization would be an unprecedented turnaround for a team that looked completely lifeless last year. FUT eliminate Giants Both FUT and Giants had high expectations coming into 2024. Both teams reached last year's Champions event and retained their cores through the offseason. Unfortunately, both also lost in the opening matches of Group A to set up an elimination duel that would send one team into a month-long break just days after a six month offseason. Against Heretics, FUT brought two agent compositions that had never been seen on the played maps before. Coming into Split, they calmed things down but still brought a cNed Chamber in to play. A pistol win got Giants' attack started on the right foot, but FUT made sure to end the half right. A round 10 thrifty win from FUT broke open the floodgates for an 8-4 halftime lead. Giants completely crumbled to lose the map 13-6. FUT were led by a consistent kill per round average from a rookie yetujey . Cloud continued the tournament trend of being Giants only consistent performer. His map leading 20 kills couldn't bail out a disastrous team effort. Continuing their mission to leave no agent composition left unplayed, FUT chose chaos on Icebox by bringing Phoenix, Chamber, and Fade, all unconventional picks forming the core of a five agent lineup never before seen in tracked professional games on any map. Giants looked like they were going to run away with their attack before another 10th round thrifty from FUT broke things open. Despite dominating the gun rounds, it took a 1v3 Sheriff clutch from Cloud to salvage a halftime advantage for Giants. Takeoff On a map which revolves around extremely open and difficult spike plants, FUT's composition gave them very few tools to work with on their attack. Nearly every round was an uphill struggle to get any space to plant, and Giants easily rolled to a 13-8 victory. Facing elimination, FUT came into Sunset firing on all cylinders. They repeatedly launched successful attacks on the B site for six rounds in a row before Giants found the solution of adding extra B defenders and retaking A. It took until the final round of the half before FUT finally got to seven. Giants ran out of steam in a second half rout, leading to a 13-7 FUT victory. Every member of FUT finished with more kills than all of Giants except for MrFaliN who sat at the bottom but IGL'd his team to victory. Giants have been eliminated, and will not play until Stage 2 in April. FUT survive to face off against KCorp for a shot at the Play-In stage. Banner image by Michal Konkol/Riot Games"

    "cleaned_content": "Trace Esports have defeated TYLOO 2-0 in the first-ever VCT China match. FunPlus Phoenix , meanwhile, debuted their newly improved roster with a 2-0 of their own. Today's victors advance to the Group A Winner's match, where they will face off against each other for a spot in playoffs. TYLOO and Nova Esports , meanwhile, will next play in the group's Elimination match. Trace Esports defeat TYLOO in China opener Trace come into Kickoff as one of few teams to make no changes to their starting roster. This lineup debuted almost exactly one year ago, under the Totoro Gaming banner. Historically they have never been the best, regularly finishing in the top six, but they have reached a grand final on one occasion. TYLOO feature a similar roster to the one fielded throughout the VCT China's spiritual predecessor, the Evolution Series , keeping the same core. The fifth player rotated across 2023, but Attacking Soul Esports not entering the partnership allowed TYLOO an opportunity to pick up fan-favorite zjc . A packed arena witnessed the series begin on Ascent, picked by TYLOO. They took the initial pistol round, quickly responded by a Trace eco. A short back-and-forth followed, later interrupted by five straight wins from Trace. TYLOO were able to win round 12 to end the half, setting the score 8-4 in their opponent's favor. The second half only increased the gap, as TYLOO never managed to recover their footing. Trace closed out the map with another five round streak, ending the game with an unceremonious 13-4. Interestingly, TYLOO started with the upper hand across multiple rounds, but were almost never able to capitalize on their advantage. Trace won three eco rounds to start the map, two clutches, and multiple rounds with a player inferiority. Flex1n finds four The entire team contributed to the scoreline, notably Trace's initiator and in-game leader heybay who finished with 308 ACS and 12 assists. Flex1n was another standout player, winning a 1v2 clutch and granting his team round 15 with a 4k. Map two was even more dominant. Both teams opted for fairly unorthodox compositions, but Trace was better able to justify their agent picks. By round 7, Yiyee, TYLOO's coach, had used both his team's timeouts. Trace won the following two rounds. The half ended with Trace up 11-1, the final round won by FengF and Kai pushing into the opposing team's spawn. Trace confidently push TYLOO back TYLOO won consolation pistol and anti-eco rounds, but Trace quickly answered back with two of their own. The inaugural match concluded with a 13-3, sending Trace to the Group A Winner's match and leaving TYLOO one loss away from elimination. FunPlus Phoenix return to VCT with 2-0 victory A close fight from NOVA on map one was not enough against the more experienced FunPlus Phoenix squad, who took the win 2-0. Pre-season expectations put both teams on opposite ends on the spectrum, with FunPlus Phoenix lauded as a top team, particularly following the acquisition of one of the better duelists in the region, Life . On the other hand, doubts surrounded NOVA's decision to maintain a core that had never qualified to any of the Chinese events in 2023. FunPlus Phoenix is one of the few Chinese teams to make an appearance in an international event, invited to LOCK//IN due to their results in the local circuit the year prior. They were also one of three teams from the region to qualify to Champions 2023 . Unfortunately, they only won a single map across both events. FunPlus Phoenix continued to make roster changes across the year, welcoming Autumn and picking up Life after his previous team was not invited to VCT China. Their opponents, NOVA Esports, feature a core that they have kept since their entry into Valorant in 2023. During the year they participated in eleven different open qualifiers for six different tournaments, failing to make the respective main event every time. Ahead of the season, they acquired GuanG from Royal Never Give Up and Russian duelist neveR from MENA Challengers. The series began on NOVA's map pick, Sunset. They won the pistol round, but failed to convert the next, after a Snakebite from Lysoar denied GuanG's heroics. Undeterred, GuanG netted the first ace of the event, granting his team a short-lived lead. GuanG scores an ace A close round four equalized the score, and FPX earned a lead of their own. The deadly duo of autumn and Life was instrumental in picking apart the opposing team's defense, and they were able to finish the half 7-5. After the break, FPX took the pistol round and further extended the round differential. GuanG proved too much to handle, however, and the underdogs were able to tie the scoreline 10-10. A reset from FPX and back-to-back triple kills from Life was enough to deny a comeback, and NOVA lost their map pick 13-10. Statistically, GuanG's 29 eliminations and 357 ACS made him the best performer. In terms of value provided to his team, however, Life arguably contributed more, and his 22 eliminations are nothing to scoff at. He found a comparable amount of multikills and first kills, but he also helped restrict NOVA's advances, including helping shut down GuanG's aggressive Neon. The match went on to Lotus, FunPlus Phoenix's most played map in the past year and one of their best in terms of winrate. They continued to play with their double controller Chamber composition, playing into their strengths and comfort picks. NOVA picked a double duelist formation, with ideas of maximizing their aggressive potential seen on the previous map. They had interesting ideas initially, coordinating set plays and showing understanding of how FPX intended to play. o0o0o 's Raze play set the pace for the half, as he led the charge for his team their entire offense. FPX's timing wins the round A number of well-timed kills from AAAAY and a change of style from full retaking to a bit more anchoring and focusing on delays put FPX up 7-5 by half time. It was all uphill from there. FPX returned from the pause with a pistol round, and they did not lose momentum afterwards. Lysoar and AAAAY were key to their attack. Lysoar opened up three different rounds with a first kill and doubled his eliminations to 20, while AAAAY continued to help close out the rounds. The duo's perfomance ended the map 13-5, putting them a match away from playoffs and sending NOVA to the lower bracket."

Gen.G grab victory from the jaws of brutal defeat Gen.G celebrate after beating Team Secret at the VCT 2024 Pacific Kickoff. (Image via Riot Games) When the series began, with the map picks of Breeze from Team Secret, Lotus from Gen.G, and Icebox as the decider, compositions were key. In Breeze, Gen.G had a tough time with the solo initiator Skye, while the KAYO and Sova from Team Secret was crucial in their playstyle. Throughout the entire attack half, Gen.G only got the bomb planted twice, and were only able to win one round on their defense. 13-5 was kind to Gen.G, as Team Secret looked in prime position to win the series quickly, especially with how strong Jeremy \" Jremy \" Cabrera was on Jett. Lotus had to be the turning point for Gen.G, and the big difference in the teams was the initiators once again. Team Secret decided to run the solo Skye, while Gen.G rocked the solo Fade. Jremy kept his form up, and the first half ended 8-4 for Team Secret, looking to close the series out. However, two players on Gen.G just didn't feel like losing anymore, as Kim \" Meteor \" Tae-o led his team with six first bloods and zero first deaths on the Killjoy, while Kim \" t3xture \" Na-ra led the charge on Raze. Both combined to lead a comeback on their attack side, starting down 8-4 but only losing one round, ending the map 13-9 and tying the series. It all came down to Icebox, where Gen.G looked to have ripped the momentum from Team Secret's hands. Starting on defense, Gen.G took the lead, with Byeon \" Munchkin \" Sang-beom on the KAYO dropping 18 kills in the first half alone. Another 8-4 half was prime to lead to an easy map, but Team Secret used their defense to nearly take the game up 12-10. Gen.G had to win the final two rounds just to take it to overtime, which they just managed to do. Soon as overtime came around, it all came down to the smallest of factors. The first two overtime rounds were traded to each team, but then Gen.G used a solid defense on A site and a Kim \" Lakia \" Jong-min duel to get the map and the series win. Team Secret demolishes ZETA in quick 2-0 sweep Team Secret, after sweeping ZETA at the VCT 2024 Pacific Kickoff. (Image via Riot Games) For this matchup, Team Secret started with Icebox, a repeat of their last map from the match against Gen.G, one they lost. ZETA DIVISION picked Ascent, leaving Lotus as the decider for the series. While Team Secret ran the same comp they did against Gen.G, ZETA decided to swap the Sage for a Harbor for more smokes. While the pick itself can be valuable, ZETA began the game slow, looking like last year's team with very passive holds focusing on retakes. The ideas behind ZETA weren't bad, but Team Secret took every inch of space ZETA offered and focused Yuma \" Dep \" Hashimoto, allowing for their talent to pop off to a 9-0 lead. It took a monster round from Dep to stop the potential 13-0, but the half still ended in Team Secret's favor, up 11-1. It was funny to see Dep leading the scoreboard on both teams despite only winning one round, with 15 kills, but he was the only one on ZETA hitting important shots. A 4K from Jessie Cristy \" JessieVash \" Cuyco on pistols and an ace from Jremy on the final round put the nail in the coffin, with a near-perfect 13-1 map win. Ascent was up next, and a won pistol from ZETA already matched the amount of round wins from Icebox. All jokes aside, the compositions were mirrored, once again putting the pressure on the Jett players to push on attack, or the Killjoy on defense. Dep kept his form early on Ascent, with everyone else on ZETA stepping up to take a significant 5-1 lead. Team Secret fought back, but ZETA ended the half up 7-5, moving to the defense side. A pistol win and a bonus conversion put Team Secret back on top, with multiple key solo duels from Adrian \" invy \" Reyes proving the difference. ZETA looked improved over map one, but Team Secret took their game time from Gen.G and rode it to another confident map win, 13-8. Gen.G sweep ZETA to lock in Kickoff playoff spot With how the previous two games went, ZETA was effectively eliminated from the Kickoff playoffs due to losing both maps, and in significant fashion. This meant that even if they won this final game, they would not qualify due to map differential being in Secret or Gen.G's favor. With that in mind, this game was win and in for Gen.G, but lose and out, with Team Secret taking that playoff slot instead. For maps, Gen.G picked Icebox, ZETA picked Ascent, leaving Lotus as the potential decider. Starting on Icebox, its third appearance of the day, both ZETA and Gen.G ran the same comps they had earlier in the play-ins. That meant Harbor for ZETA, while Lakia went back to the Gekko. Off the bat, it looked like déjà vu for ZETA, starting slow, while Meteor continued his strong form from earlier in the day. ZETA snuck a defuse to get their first round down 4-1, then Gen.G proceeded to fumble two rounds in a row, keeping ZETA alive. It didn't change the fact that Gen.G went into the half up, but only 8-4. On their attack side, ZETA won a crucial pistol to keep the map within reach. Gen.G were playing well on retakes as soon as both teams had even weaponry, using Gekko's utility to get through Harbor's smokes with much less worry. What seemed like a pushback was a mirage, as Gen.G won the map 13-6. Ascent was next, with the teams yet again mirroring each other with the double initiator. Gen.G won the first pistol and converted the bonus round, thanks to t3xture and his Sheriff wallbangs. For the fourth map in a row, ZETA started the map behind, reaching the half down 10-2. One of the standouts, much like earlier in the day, was Munchkin, helping knock ZETA down every time they had hope of pushing A site. Gen.G, after qualifying to the VCT 2024 Pacific Kickoff playoffs. (Image via Riot Games) It was effectively curtains when Gen.G reached double digits on the first half, closing out the map 13-4, series 2-0, and play-in portion of the tournament. After the match, Meteor talked about the grind of the play-in day, and \"It was tough, difficult, and we gave everything in that series against Team Secret,\" Meteor said post-match. \"I was nervous that we would run out of energy, but we got that last ticket to the playoffs.\" Gen.G will compete alongside T1 , DRX , and Paper Rex in the Pacific Kickoff playoffs, with two teams making it to Masters Madrid."

    "cleaned_content": "In a battle of experienced cores vs. fresh new rosters, several standing contenders fell. Team Heretics took down group favorite FUT Esports 2-0 despite a substitute player, and Karmine Corp knocked off GIANTX in the first day of VCT EMEA play in 2024. Shorthanded Heretics upset FUT The cards were stacked against Heretics from the start. An EMEA bottom feeder that floundered in the offseason, had to use a substitute because one of their star acquisitions is too young to play, and had one player forced to play remotely due to visa issues came into their match as massive underdogs against an internationally competitive FUT team that picked up cNed in the offseason. In the end, Heretics stunned the entire league with a 2-0 upset. The Lithuanian Boo brothers dominated the server, with the elder Boo showing off both aim and brain to start off his redemption arc from a disastrous 2023 season. Young Turkish star Wo0t was picked up by Heretics with the intention that he would be a core piece of their future, but as a 17 year old, he is too young to compete in VCT events until partway through March, forcing the team to bring in paTiTek as a substitute . To complicate matters, Heretics have struggled to obtain visas for their Turkish players leading to RieNs having to play remotely. On the other side of the arena, FUT came into 2024 with big expectations. They finished top eight at Champions last year and scooped up a former world champion star player in cNed while maintaining their Turkish lineup. Offseason victories over contenders from all the VCT leagues besides China only added to the hype. As one of the teams that set the meta on Lotus when it was introduced in 2023, FUT once again aimed to set a new tone. A solo controller Astra along with Gekko, Yoru, Breach, and Killjoy formed a lineup never before seen on Lotus. FUT dominated the individual duels early on their attack. A 4-0 start had the makings of a blowout before Heretics found their footing. The shorthanded squad took defensive Rubble control at the start of each round to limit FUT's maneuverability around the map, and coordinated retakes completely turned the momentum. An eco ace from AtaKaptan finally stemmed the bleeding, but the damage was done. A 7-5 lead is often insufficient when switching to Lotus defense. Ata boy. Without a second controller like the near ubiquitous Viper pick, FUT struggled to hold any map control on defense. Heretics got the spike planted in every single round with ease. The Turks had a chance to stave off Heretics from equalizing at 10 rounds apiece, but the defuse was 0.07 seconds too late, and Heretics eventually took the map 13-11. The brother buff paid off as Boo and MiniBoo combined for 48 kills to carry the load. Heretics tried to one up FUT in the wild agent picks by choosing Astra and Sova on Bind, but FUT matched them with an equally unusual Neon composition. For the second time in two tries, FUT picked a composition that had never been seen before on the map. The game picked up right where Lotus left off. FUT's defense looked porous, and on the other side, the oldest player in the server continued to win every aim duel. After a rough 2023 campaign, Boo's IGLing and individual capabilities were called into question, but both looked stellar despite the circumstances. A few Operator rounds from cNed salvaged five rounds in the half for FUT, and on their own attack, they consistently punished defensive aggression towards A from Heretics. Unfortunately for them, they never found traction towards the B side of the map, and the Boos continued to light up the kill feed. Heretics converted their lead into a 13-10 victory for the series win. Boo getting jumpscared by a ghost? Not happening. Even when he is Mini. Boo finished the series 52-29 with a 1.45 rating to lead all players in the server by a wide margin. Both Patitek and RieNs struggled individually, but the team overcame their circumstances to notch their first marque win earlier than most anticipated. Karmine Corp take down Giants After an année désastreuse in 2023, KCorp chose a radical new direction for their roster. They added a first time IGL in MAGNUM and three rookie star duelists from Challenger leagues around the world. For the first eight rounds of their attack, Giants played about as passively as they could have. They waited behind their own spawn doors with only the barest hint of mid pressure before executing into one of the sites. This strategy paid off in the pistol and gun rounds, but it cost them in multiple anti-eco rounds where the late round clock forced them to rush into weaker weapons. The star duo of N4RRATE and marteen began to light up the scoreboard with multikill after multikill, and KCorp fought back for a tied halftime score. What on Earth. In contrast to Giants, KCorp chose to deathball on their attack. They roared out into the lead, and a late rally by Cloud and nukkye was unable to prevent a 13-11 KCorp victory. N4RRATE finished with a map high 23 kills to lead an explosive effort from the young team. Giants picked Sunset but immediately had the fight taken to them by KCorp. Giants' attempts to push through mid and Market with a Sage wall were stymied early on. A pair of 4Ks from hoody finally broke the game open, and Giants roared out to a first half lead. Aftershock of the year so far. Cloud showed his Bulldog had some bite and not just bark, stringing together critical multikills to push Giants to map point up 12-5. KCorp mounted a valiant comeback, but a miscommunication led to a ninja defuse to end the map 13-10. Despite Lotus having long been the most attacker sided map in the game, Giants' attack fell completely flat, losing the first seven rounds in a row. They somehow salvaged three rounds in the half off the back of a round where they ran out of time to plant but miraculously found all the kills. No time, no problem. In the end, KCorp easily rolled to a 13-4 victory to take the match. Across the series, MAGNUM and his three rookies finished with a higher kill total and rating than all of Giants except Cloud. Fit1nho had a great start to the series but finished with well over 50% of his kills in that first map. Heretics will face Karmine Corp for a spot in the EMEA playoffs while FUT and Giants have been relegated to the losers bracket where they will have to battle just to escape into the Play-In stage. Both games will take place on Thursday the 22nd. Banner image by Michal Konkol/Riot Games"

DetonatioN FocusMe are now the second Pacific team to be eliminated from the tournament, joining BLEED in the metaphoric Pacific League waiting room. Team Secret bid DetonatioN farewell Team Secret opened the fourth day of Kickoff by eliminating DetonatioN FocusMe from the competition, following a 2-0 victory. Team Secret will next play against Talon Esports for a chance at advancing to the play-in stage. This match was crucial for both teams, as losing meant missing out on official matches until early April, the beginning of the Pacific League. It also represented an opportunity for DetonatioN to find their first match win, as they had a 12 game losing streak prior to this series. Team Secret, meanwhile, looked to redeem themselves from a disappointing opening match. The map veto saw DetonatioN picking Lotus, Secret selecting Breeze, and Ascent remaining as the decider. Both teams played their respective selection in their previous match, and both teams lost the map 13-8. Team Secret started out with a strong Lotus offense, quickly building up an 8-0 lead with little response from the Japanese squad. Finally, on round 9, Medusa and Meiy granted their team a round, but it was too little, too late. Secret closed out the half with a resounding 9-3. Desperation kicks in for the Japanese lineup After halftime, the Filipino team won another pistol round. A full sheriff, no shields buy from DetonatioN did not pay off, granting their opponents a flawless round 14. They were able to turn things around, however, scoring four rounds in a row. Eventually, Team Secret capitalized on their lead, winning the final two rounds to close out Lotus 13-7. Compared to the match against Talon Esports, NDG 's performance was night-and-day. Just on the first map he more than doubled his eliminations, with 19 compared to a total of 9 against Talon. He also scored a 1.24 rating and 253 ACS, the third best performance in the server behind Jremy and Meiy. In the post-match interview, NDG commented on the difference between the matches. “At first my monitor was off, so I cannot kill,” he said. “Now, we did our part, individually,” he added. “We do our best.” The match continued on Breeze, which both teams lost 13-8 in their previous series. This time, DetonatioN won their first pistol round of the tournament going up 2-0. Their opponents quickly equalized and pushed ahead, with NDG denying a clutch from neth setting the score at 4-2. A back-and-forth ensued, ending the half 7-5. The Japan-based team was able to win another pistol round, including the bonus, which granted them a bit of a lead. Back-to-back triple kills from Jremy pushed the needle in their favor, capped off by a clutch from JessieVash . Secret deny a thrifty Three more round wins from DetonatioN followed, but it was not enough. Team Secret won their final three rounds decisively, capitalizing on the building pressure felt by their opponents. Jremy was the map's standout player, redeeming himself in similar fashion to NDG. He ended the map with 27 eliminations, one less than his total against Talon Esports. Both players were the best and third-best performers of the match, with a 1.25 rating and 1.07 rating, respectively. Meiy, meanwhile, took second place, with only 4 kills and 1 ACS less than his duelist counterpart. The result extends DetonatioN's winless streak, now at 13 losses since LOCK//IN. Including OFF//SEASON and pre-partnership matches, the org stands at 20 straight series without a single victory, going back to May 2022. Team Secret's victory means they stay alive in the tournament, next playing in a rematch against Talon to keep their Masters Madrid hopes alive. DRX qualify to playoffs with 2-0 victory The Group B Winner's final pit Korean superstars DRX against a newly-built Talon Esports. DRX managed to take the series 2-0, securing a spot in playoffs and earning a few days' rest. For Talon, the loss does not mean the end of their run. They are able to continue in the tournament, playing a decider match against Team Secret, who they previously bested 2-0. The series had a favorable map selection for the group's favorites, DRX. They opted to begin on Split, historically the team's best map. Talon picked Ascent, confident after a dominant 13-3 just two days prior. Should it be necessary, the match would continue into Breeze, a team in which both teams have shown comfort. Split began with a strong attacking half from the Korean squad, propelled by a pistol and bonus round win. Only JitBoyS managed to mitigate the damage, finding a triple kill and two clutches to keep the score gap honest. Despite JitBoyS' best efforts, Talon remained on the back foot the entire match Foxy9 's Viper was crucial to their offense. He secured the pistol round with a 4k and ended the half with a 92% KAST, 3 first kills, and 14 eliminations. “I'm confident I can do every role perfectly,” he stated. The second half allowed his veteran teammates, stax and MaKo , to shine. They contributed 11 kills each, scoring a 1.24 and 1.31 rating respectively. After winning the pistol, Talon won three rounds in a row, tying the score 8-8. A triple kill from stax and clutch from MaKo followed, setting up DRX to win the next three rounds. The two teams then traded wins until, eventually, DRX concluded the map 13-10. Talon Esports looked to map two to equalize the score. Ascent is one of DRX's preferred maps, boasting a 75% win rate and even going undefeated in Champions 2022 (6-0 record) against some of the best teams in the world. Talon, meanwhile, had recent results on their side dominating Team Secret 13-3 thanks to Governor and lenne 's play. Though DRX won another pistol round, Talon were the ones to push ahead. They took six rounds in their attacking side, but their opponents were able to draw the score 6-6. Flashback prevents Talon from setting up Talon Esports maintained the upper hand on the defense-sided map, winning a pistol of their own and setting themselves up for success with an 8-6 lead. DRX's upstart duo had other plans, however. Foxy9 helped turn things around with a triple kill in the bonus round, and Flashback 's lurks added two triples of his own. DRX carried this momentum over to win the final seven rounds of the map, sending Talon to the Decider match with a 13-8 score. While Flashback continues to show off his near-perfect gamesense and timing, the BuZz -Foxy9 spearhead was the standout in the final map. They netted a combined total of 40 eliminations, as well as a respective 7/0 first-kill first-death ratio and six assists. This performance was reflected in their rating, as BuZz achieved a 1.36 and Foxy9 a 1.50. Foxy9 mentioned his team's confidence against Talon. “We expected the result,” he said after the match."

MIBR and Sentinels will move on to play their group decider match. This also means that FURIA and 100 Thieves are the first teams to be eliminated from the first Americas tournament of the 2024 season. The first battle of Brazil in 2024 goes to MIBR The MIBR Valorant roster for 2024. (Image via MIBR) The three maps were MIBR's pick of Split, FURIA's pick of Breeze, and finally Lotus as the decider, if needed. To start, the two teams both ran aggressive double duelist compositions, with only one initiator per team. Both had Skye, who was recently nerfed, so retakes were tough for the defenders on either team. MIBR started with a lead on their defense, but ended the half down 7-5 to FURIA. It looked like FURIA were about to take a big lead after getting pistols, but a quick thrifty was an early sign in the second half that this would be a close map. MIBR retook the lead at 9-8 off of a crucial Operator duel win from Matheus \" RgLMeister \" Rodigoli. As MIBR pulled away, it was clear that their retakes were a lot cleaner, thanks to the prime performance from Leandro \" frz \" Gomes on Viper. It took FURIA's Leonardo \" mwzera \" Serrati to get a swift 4K to get their next round win, but MIBR were already on map point, winning the next round and the map 13-9. The second map of Breeze had to be a bounce back map for FURIA, needing to adapt faster than they did at the end of Split. The team compositions were similar to each other, now with the focus on the Jett players instead of the Skye players, as well as a potential redemption for Ilan \" havoc \" Eloy's poor KAY/O play in FURIA's previous game against NRG. Well, havoc must've wanted to show that his last Breeze performance was a fluke, as he top fragged in the first half with 14 kills, helped defend A site well, and led FURIA to an 8-4 lead at the half. MIBR managed to start the second half well, fighting to tie the game at 10-10. The catalyst to this comeback was Arthur \" artzin \" Araujo, who had a nasty flick to win the Jett 1v1 against mwzera, then started the next round with a collateral. It got really close to reaching overtime, but MIBR were able to take that momentum and close the map out 13-11, winning the series and staying alive in the Americas Kickoff. When it came to the pressure of the local matchup, RgLMeister acknowledged how tough the win was, but also warned his contemporaries about this win; what could be the start of a run. “We know FURIA has a really good team, we had to work hard to get the victory today,” RgLMeister said post-match. “Be careful [other teams], because we're coming for that spot in Madrid.” As the winner of the match, MIBR remain alive in the tournament, needing to win their next game to make it to the play-in stage. If that happens, they'll compete in a round-robin to qualify to the playoff stage and compete in the single-elimination bracket to get one of two Masters Madrid spots. FURIA, on the other hand, will have to wait until Stage 1 begins in a couple of months to face off against regional talent once again. Sentinels use strong Split defense to secure win over 100 Thieves Asuna from 100 Thieves. (Image via 100 Thieves) Now, everyone knew heading into this match that one promising American team would be eliminated, meaning a long break and no Masters Madrid. Considering the popularity around both of the rosters, a large chunk of fans would be disappointed no matter what. Sentinels were 2-0'd by LOUD earlier this tournament, while 100 Thieves lost a close series to powerhouse LEVIATÁN . The maps for this series started with 100 Thieves' map pick of Lotus, followed by Sentinels picking Bind. After the final two bans, this left the decider map as Split. For Lotus, the team compositions were pretty standard, outside a comfort Chamber pick from Matthew \" Cryocells \" Panganiban and 100 Thieves. The long sight lines on Lotus favor Chamber on both attack and defense, but usually players are quicker to pick more flexible sentinel agents, like the Killjoy that Sentinels had. In the early parts of Lotus, Sentinels were more coordinated, despite some crispy shots from the Headhunter of Cryo. It wasn't until he got an Operator in his hands that 100 Thieves got their first round win, off a retake on C site. Sentinels were always aware of off-angles that Chamber could be, picking off Cryo or forcing him to retreat without much value. That was key to their score at the half, up 9-3, hoping the curse wouldn't come around. Then, a quick pistol win got Sentinels just two rounds away from winning 100 Thieves' map pick. Despite a little bit of pushback, Sentinels just saved up key ultimates and won key duels to win the first map confidently, 13-5. For the second map of Bind, 100 Thieves had to start a series comeback on their opponent's map pick. We saw the return of some weird yet viable Bind agent picks, with Tyson \" TenZ \" Ngo on Yoru and Kelden \" Boostio \" Pupello back on Gekko. Both of these agents had their moments early on, but the understanding of Yoru's abilities was immaculate from TenZ, with plenty of smart teleports and unique pop flashes. However, it was the agent and the player with the green hair that got ahead heading into the half, as Boostio clutched the last round of the half to help 100 Thieves go up 8-4. Then, on 100 Thieves' defense, their goal was to spam enemies with their utility as soon as they attempted to plant, especially on A site. Gekko molly, Brimstone molly, Viper molly, Raze nade, and Fade's Seize all combo together well to prevent plants, and the close corners of Bind allow for plenty of value. No matter how Sentinels wanted to plant A, they would either die trying, or be too weak to hold it well. The map ended quickly, with 100 Thieves winning in a dominant 13-6 fashion. This meant map three, with Split on the cards to see who remains in the running for Madrid. The Gekko remained for 100 Thieves' comp, but Sentinels decided to run a standard Split comp with Cypher, Viper, and Skye. From the pistols to the half, every time a team seemed to gain momentum, the other team stopped them, notably the big thrifty win from 100 Thieves on round 11. While not tied, Sentinels held a small 7-5 lead at the half, now going to their defensive side. Sentinels' 2024 Valorant roster. (Image via Sentinels) Sentinels kept the lead despite some heroics from Cyro, with one of the highlights being johnqt's immaculate triple kill at B main. As the map went on, Sentinels seemed to be reading 100 Thieves' fakes well, never rotating too quickly and getting crucial picks late in rounds. Even with Boostio having plenty of plants, retakes were clean from Sentinels, building up the largest lead of the map just as 100 Thieves' hopes of playing in March slipped away. Gustavo \" Sacy \" Rossi ended it all with a patient 2K, ending the map 13-8 and series 2-1. With this win, Sentinels will be facing the losers of the LOUD and Leviatán, with the winner going to the play-in stage. Out of all the players on Sentinels, new IGL Mohamed Amine \" johnqt \" Ouarid stood out in their final map, not feeling much issue with his team's performance while aware of their tough group in this tournament. “It's pretty easy to lead them, they make my job pretty easy,” johnqt said post-match. “Everyone was laser focused for months now.” As for his performance on Split, top fragging alongside Sacy, he said that he knew he could not only lead a team with his strategies, but with his aim. “I worked very hard to get here, working very hard on my mechanics. It might surprise other people, but [my performance] doesn't surprise me.”"

G2 will face Evil Geniuses in the Group C decider match to qualify for the playoffs stage. KRÜ will play the loser of that match to see who will advance to the play-ins stage. “It was a grueling win for us. Nothing was easy and we earned it hard,” G2 IGL valyn said post-match. “I want to shout out my team, we showed incredible resilience and we played phenomenal.” Both teams had middling results during their offseason tournament appearances before Americas Kickoff with their new additions. KRÜ failed to take a single map at Superdome 2023: Colombia , while G2 managed just one series win at the Sentinels Invitational in November. G2 came out guns blazing to start their VCT Americas debut, jumping to a 5-2 attacking lead on their map pick of Icebox. The Chilean KRÜ squad responded by tying things up at 6-6 at halftime, spurred on by new additions of Shyy and mta , the former of which secured an ace in a key round 10. In the second half, G2 opened by playing full retake on the B site, winning the first three rounds off the back of that strategy. KRÜ answered with seven straight rounds of their own to take the map, mostly by attacking the A bombsite, and changing their postplant strategy to take more aggressive angles on the hold. New year, same old keznit . It was an all-around strong performance from every member of KRÜ, but a keznit ace in round 20 and Melser 's 1v2 clutch in the final round solidified the win. valyn performed extremely well with the interesting Brimstone pick, leading the lobby in kills and ACS. Map two brought the teams to Sunset, where KRÜ introduced a no-duelist composition with keznit on Chamber. After a pistol and anti-eco win from G2 to kick off the map, KRÜ found success on their site hits time and time again to find a 5-2 lead. A JonahP ace with a guardian on an eco round and multiple leaf 3Ks halted KRÜ's momentum enough to bring the teams to yet another 6-6 half. Just one of the critical eco round wins for G2 during the series. After KRÜ took their first pistol of the series to open their defensive side, G2 proceeded to win seven of the next eight rounds to secure their first map win of VCT Americas. The ascended G2 squad looked eerily comfortable on their attack side, exploiting every hole that the defense had to offer with a variety of fakes and patient play. Ascent was to be the deciding map between the teams. keznit's attacking Jett play propelled KRÜ to an early 5-3 lead with a 12-4 start, a stark difference to leaf 's 1-7 start on the defensive Jett. G2 battled back a bit, but still faced a 7-5 deficit on the defense-sided map. One of the final nails in the coffin for KRÜ. leaf came alive on G2's own attack side, helping bring the North American squad to a 10-9 lead. The back-and-forth affair continued to the penultimate round where at 12-11, KRÜ could not hold on to the B bombsite to force overtime. Across the entire series keznit looked like his old self, putting up a 16-8 first kill ratio and leading the entire lobby in kills and ACS. JonahP performed extremely well along with his IGL valyn to spearhead the win for G2. “Shyy and mta will have to learn to get used to a new playstyle, but I think that they will learn to go crazy like keznit doing keznit things,” KRÜ coach Atom said during the match. “With all three of them, we are a really dangerous team.”"

    "cleaned_content": "Day two of VCT Pacific saw ZETA DIVISION beat Global Esports 2-0, TALON upset Team Secret with a 2-0 of their own, and DRX cap off the day with a 2-0 against DetonatioN FocusMe . ZETA will next play T1 and Talon will play DRX, respectively, to determine which team advances to playoffs. Their opponents are now in their group's elimination match. Global will play against BLEED and Team Secret will face off against DetonatioN FocusMe. ZETA debut with 2-0 over Global Esports The day began with yesterday's postponed match, ZETA vs. Global Esports. The latter picked the first map, Bind, with ZETA opting for Icebox and Sunset left as decider. Both teams feature fairly different squads compared to last year. Global underwent a full rebuild, promoting substitute Lightningfast and adding four new players. Spin moved to the head coach position following Eraser 's departure. ZETA, meanwhile, replaced two with hiroronn and yuran , and brought in Carlao as head coach. Laz was optimistic about the new additions. “It's easier with the new members,” he said. “It works really well; they understand what we're trying to tell them.” ZETA won the opening pistol round, courtesy of an early defuse. A failed forcebuy attempt by Global saw ZETA taking the next two rounds, delaying their bonus into round four. The South Asian org was then able to win three of their own, taking advantage of ZETA's passive defense on A. A well executed retake led by yuran and quad kill from Dep put them back in the lead, however. Those two rounds were enough to make a difference, ending the half 7-5 in favor of ZETA Division. Dep finds four with the op Dep and Laz, team veterans, were definite standouts in the first half. They were able to keep Global's ideas in check, controlling either side of the map between the two. Despite a pistol win from Global to close the gap, they were unable to string together enough rounds to take their map. Ultimately, ZETA closed out the scoreline 13-10. Moving onto Icebox, both teams had orthodox team comps, with the only difference being ZETA favoring Harbor over Global's KAY/O. The map appeared to be as close as Bind, both teams equalizing 6-6 by the half. Polvi had a standout half, with a 1.45 rating and 5 first kills. hiroronn and Laz helped mitigate the damage, however, with 11 eliminations apiece. yuran 's Viper smothers Global Dashing any potential for renewed hope from Global, ZETA showed that their past expertise and comfort on the map paired well with their new additions' raw skill. They were able to leverage their opponent's aggression against them, taking advantage of their impatience and positioning. Dep and yuran completely took over the match, their combined 23 kills easing the team into a nearly flawless attack and eventual 13-7 win. Talon upset Secret in dominant fashion The second match featured Team Secret facing off against a newly restructured Talon Esports. The first map of the match was Breeze, selected by Talon. Secret picked Ascent, and Sunset was left as the final map, should it be needed. Team Secret, who peaked as finalists of the LCQ last year, made few roster moves in the off-season, replacing DubsteP with NDG and releasing their substitute, lenne , who played a single official map for the team in 2023. The newly available Singaporean player found himself on Talon as their in-game leader. The Hong Kong org went for a more drastic off-season compared to Secret's. They released three players and their head coach, and Patiphan decided to move to the inactive roster. As replacements ban , previously on T1, and North American Challengers player Governor joined lenne for the 2024 roster. Finally, Surf joined as sixth, reuniting with Crws after one year. “We knew how much it meant for lenne,” Governor said regarding his history with Team Secret. “I really wanted to win this one [for him].” The first half of Breeze was highlighted by Talon's aggression. Spearheaded by their double duelist composition, they took an early defense lead. Notably, Governor was able to avoid dying at all in the first five rounds. Governor kept Team Secret at bay the whole match He kept the momentum going the rest of the half, ending with a 2.10 rating and 19/4 KD. This performance, paired with ban's Yoru, helped the team end the half 9-3. Secret managed to put up more of a fight in the second half, winning the pistol and an additional three rounds. Unfortunately for the Filipino team, Talon's lead proved too large to handle, as they only needed four more rounds to win the map. The match continued on Talon's map pick, Ascent. Both teams mirrored their decision to play the standard composition. Once again, Talon started with an early defense lead. Equally dominant, Governor was able to take control of the half with another 19/4 KD statline. Just like Breeze, the first half ended 9-3, with JessieVash contributing two of those rounds. Unlike Breeze, however, Team Secret were unable to answer back in the second half. Talon won the pistol and next three rounds to close the map with a resounding 13-3. “I was definitely nervous,” Governor said regarding his feelings prior to the match. “For the first two rounds, a bit,” he later clarified. lenne 's Sova helped his team win 13-3 Although he ended Ascent with 399 ACS and a 2.16 rating, lenne was just as impressive. The debutant IGL was able to anticipate Secret's every move, all while earning a 2.00 rating of his own and his fair share of highlights. DRX breeze past DetonatioN with 2-0 win The final series of the day pit DRX, the first place team in the Pacific 2023 regular season , against DetonatioN FocusMe, the tenth place team in the regular season. The teams picked Breeze and Lotus respectively, agreeing on Bind as the decider map. Heading into the season, DRX made significant changes to their roster. While keeping a core of three players and their coaching staff, they let go of Rb and Zest , both players who have been a part of the team since 2020. Flashback and Foxy9 were promoted from DRX Academy and the team's bench, respectively, as the players' replacements. DetonatioN FocusMe, meanwhile, went for a more drastic route. Only Anthem stayed from the previous squad, as the org acquired the core of Crazy Raccoon to complete the roster and coaching staff. DRX got off to a strong start on Lotus, setting a 6-1 scoreline in their defense. In-game leader stax contributed heavily to the streak, with three first kills and 12 eliminations. DetonatioN was able to claw back to a 7-5 half, thanks in part to Meiy 's entrying. His aggression was assisted by their double controller setup, as SSeeS and neth provided the necessary followup. Meiy lead the charge for DetonatioN The Korean team took the second pistol, further extending their lead to a comfortable 9-5. A cautious retake from DFM granted them the bonus round. This began a back and forth between the teams, but in the end DRX's lead was too much for DetonatioN. DRX went into their map selection of Breeze with a new double duelist and Cypher comp. The Japanese squad, on the other hand, preferred to play with double controllers rather than the Jett-Yoru. The two teams traded rounds initially, but, as with Lotus, DRX went on a slight win streak. Once again Meiy was his team's best performer, but the other side showed off their secret weapon: Flashback. The Cypher player had 16 eliminations by halftime, with his timings and anchoring being pivotal to DRX's successful defense. DRX's rookies work in unison to secure the round With his Breeze performance, Flashback ended up at the top of the scoreboard for the match, achieving an overall rating of 1.23 and 37 total eliminations. DetonatioN tried to keep the game going in the second half, winning another four rounds. Unfortunately for them, DRX had other ideas, as another pistol round win added to the insurmountable scoreline gap. In the end, an attempt by Medusa at sticking the defuse was canceled by stax, ending DetonatioN's effort to win the map. Rookie player Flashback assured fans that the team changed beyond roster moves. “We'll be more aggressive, more attacking,” he said in the post-match interview. “We'll be a better DRX.”"

    "cleaned_content": "The offseason trended in vastly different directions for LEVIATÁN and 100 Thieves , but in their opening match of 2024, it all came back together in a nail-biting series where LEV barely snuck by 100T. After dominant showings on Bind from LEV and Split from 100T, both teams finally showed up together on Icebox in a back and forth battle that went the distance in regulation. It was a dominant showing from aspas as he once again showed that he ranks among the world's best superstars. Perhaps the most hyped offseason acquisition was superstar duelist aspas to LEV, joining a core that put up huge numbers in 2023. The new look lineup went a perfect 8-0 in maps against fellow partnered teams, but then the organization made a shocking last minute decision to replace nzr , a player who rated in the top five of the Americas League last year as well as one who dominated alongside aspas during the offseason. Bringing in a world champion like C0M threw expectations into chaos, but this initial match indicates that they may be able to survive the loss of nzr. On the other side of things, 100T floundered in the offseason at multiple events as they tried to piece together a final roster, and their main hope was that a new IGL and coaching help could turn around a sinking ship. While they showed much improvement against a heavy favorite, it wasn't enough to net them a win. With Skye nerfs pushing her out of the forefront of the meta, both teams brought Gekko to Bind. Since Jett is a weaker pick on the map, Cryocells pivoted to controller while Asuna took over the duelist role. The entirety of Bind was the aspas show. He finished with 31 kills and a 10-1 first kill record as an oppressive presence in nearly every round. Whatever 100T tried on either half ran a serious risk of being dismantled by multikill. An 0-9 start from kiNgg and a couple of timely Sheriff rounds from Boostio weren't enough to keep 100T afloat against the onslaught, and LEV took the map 13-9. This man provided a much needed breath of life into 100T. LEV's attack on Split in 2023 was characterized by passive default spreads nearly every single round. While there was a little more variation this time, the echoes of past failures remained. Throughout the half it often felt like an aggressive 100T defense took more map control than LEV outside of site executes. Split was over almost before it began as LEV completely crumbled. 100T were handed full control of the initiative, and all five of their players finished with a positive opening kill differential. Cryocell's first attempt at Astra wasn't really tested as the game ended without significant attempts to challenge his site anchoring. Both teams brought new ideas to Icebox. Mazino continued to be one of the last holdouts from the Harbor-Viper meta, but LEV's big play was bringing aspas back to his roots. The man who made his name in Brazil playing Reyna finally brought it to the biggest stage. The lack of a Sage or Harbor to get safe spike plants forced 100T to commit many players to the site executes even when Asuna's Wingman did the planting for them. LEV dominated the early rounds towards A before 100T found success getting the spike planted on B. An early scare for LEV came when bang nearly netted himself an ace clutch on an eco round to clear all of LEV's weapons, but aspas immediately relieved that economic pressure in the next round with a 4K while holding LEV's only rifle. The most fearsome Reyna in all the lands. The second half was a back and forth brawl with 100T continuing to threaten to mount a comeback. LEV's Harbor pick allowed them plenty of easy postplants towards A with the entire team bailing to passive positions, but 100T found openings rushing back in on the retake with Wingman defusing. Despite Cryocells' return to Jett giving 100T a boost, LEV had a much more complete team effort along with a great showing from aspas and C0M to convert the map 13-11 after some chaotic 100T retake attempts fell just short. Across the series, aspas was the clear cut MVP with a 1.33 rating despite a dud of a second map. Although both kiNgg and tex struggled individually, the star performances from 100T never materialized when it mattered. LEV move on to face LOUD in the winners match while 100T drop to face SEN in an elimination brawl that would cut the first half of one of their seasons short almost before it finally got started.

    "cleaned_content": "The first day back in action for VCT Pacific saw Korea's T1 and Gen.G both taking wins over Southeast Asian underdogs BLEED and Rex Regum Qeon . Both teams move onto the qualification round of their respective groups, with T1 facing the winner of ZETA DIVISION vs. Global Esports , while Gen.G will face the inaugural league champion Paper Rex . T1 send BLEED and El Diablo to the lower bracket depths After an extended tech pause lasting over three hours, the first match began on Breeze, BLEED's pick. Setting the tone for the game lying ahead for both teams, both teams' compositions stood out with some striking similarities, yet stood out notably for the Singaporean side with yay locking in Neon for the first time ever in his career. BLEED got off to an early 6-1 start on their defense after taking the opening two rounds followed by four consecutive retakes in a row. An early lead for BLEED was quickly left in the dust, with Sayaplayer and iZu 's double-duelist antics scraping T1 back to an equal 6-6 half. iZu especially turned up on T1's attack side to help drive the match back into their hands. “I want to be remembered as a player that when someone asks, ‘Who is the Faker of Valorant?' everyone says iZu,” he said in his post-match interview. Out with f0rsakeN 's Yoru on Breeze, and long live iZu. A valiant effort by sScary and yay throughout the second half catapulted BLEED up to 11-8; however, T1 wouldn't go down quietly without a fight. A 0.05 second defuse by Sayaplayer brought back life in his squad, soon bringing the map to OT. Going all the way to 34 rounds, T1 ultimately came out victorious 18-16, despite two clutches by sScary. Lotus, T1's pick, saw xccurate return to his signature Chamber while yay saw yet another role swap onto Skye. T1 struck first to open up the map, taking an early 4-0 lead on their attack. After BLEED took their first round, T1 stood undeterred and quickly climbed up to take five more rounds in a row, ending the half up 9-3. Going out with a whimper, BLEED only managed to take three more rounds until T1 took the series, winning out the map 13-6. Gen.G shake off pre-season doubts Kicking off the second match of the day was a rebuilt Gen.G taking on a hopeful Rex Regum Qeon. The map veto saw the debut of a revamped Icebox in the 2024 season, with both teams running a near-mirror comp with Gekko replacing Sage's typical spot in the map's meta. Heading into the match, RRQ were riding high on the spirit of their highly anticipated signing, Jemkin . In the opening five rounds alone, the Russian duelist shot his way up to an 11-1 K/D. Neither side was able to establish a decisive lead, eventually ending the first half 6-6. But in response to Jemkin's breakout performance, t3xture fired back even harder. As rounds continued to go the way back-and-forth for both sides, t3xture was able to find consistent impact throughout both halves, racking up a staggering 33 kills by the end of the map – a 13-11 win for Gen.G. GEN's pick brought the match to Split. RRQ came out swinging with high spirits, taking revenge for their narrow loss on Icebox by steamrolling their way to an early 10-2 lead on defense. Despite a slow start for t3xture, Meteor sought to take the helm of Gen.G's fragging heading into the second half. Down 10-2, it would take nothing short of a miracle for GEN to have a hope at life. But after an explosive start to begin their defense, combined with Meteor 's Operator, the Korean team gave themselves a fighting chance. Round after round, Gen.G made a comeback all but inevitable. It wasn't until the final five rounds of regulation where RRQ won for the first time in the second half, followed by the final two rounds to win out 13-11. One of Meteor's multiple pop-off rounds on the Operator. Following two close maps, the match came down to the decider, Sunset. RRQ began by taking yet another opening pistol round to get an early 2-0 start, but quickly spiraled out of hand with another streak of retakes being won out by Gen.G to take an early 8-4 lead. Gen.G carried out six successful defuses throughout the half. t3xture saw a return to his form seen on Icebox, coming into the second half at an 21-8 K/D. After winning out the first three rounds to kick off GEN's attack, RRQ managed to fight back, getting within striking distance of Gen.G at 11-8. Despite RRQ's best attempts on their defense, Gen.G emerged on top, taking Sunset 13-8 and the series 2-1 overall. Yet, while the victory may be a triumph for the Gen.G roster overall, one man came out of the series clearly relieved more than everyone else. “I was really hangry, so I was telling the guys, ‘come on, let's go have some food and close it out'. I was able to focus on the game and finally get to have dinner,” said t3xture."

    "cleaned_content": "Despite losing one of the premier superstars in the world during the offseason, LOUD once again showed that they can rebuild a contender during a 2-0 victory over a resurgent Sentinels roster. SEN had dominated offseason events with new acquisition Zellsis replacing pANcada , but the team once again stumbled in domestic play. LOUD threw chaos to the winds with unconventional compositions, removing sentinels from their agent pools to clear Sentinels from their path to Masters Madrid. A culminating beatdown of blinding abilities from four separate agents on Ascent pushed LOUD into the winners match of Group B, two match wins away from another international berth. All offseason LOUD cautioned that they brought in ambitioN to allow flexibility to add new layers to the team rather than attempt the impossible task of filling the shoes of aspas , and Quick immediately showcased something completely new and powerful as a topfrag centerpiece for LOUD's new style. The Brazilians brought a mildly unusual double controller double initiator agent composition to Split with Quick as the sole duelist. Their plethora of utility allowed them to get positioning around the map then execute onto sites during their attack. It was Sentinels, however, that set the tone with a ninja defuse to open the map and a follow up ninja in the fourth round. A retake oriented setup has its drawbacks, illustrated nicely by a postplant ace by cauanzin to keep LOUD in the map. No ninja this time. Without a sentinel to lock down a site, LOUD had to be aggressive on their defensive half. SEN tried to make life difficult for site anchors, but they were constantly repelled from the prime staging grounds for site executes and funneled around the map. LOUD snuck in a pistol ninja defuse of their own, and it was all too easy from there. Quick and saadhak combined for more kills than the entirety of Sentinels in the second half to mount a 13-11 comeback. Strong opening duel statistics from zekken and TenZ were insufficient to stave off LOUD's dynamic midrounding, and Sacy in particular struggled with a single digit kill total. While LOUD's Split composition dabbled their toes in the unorthodox, their Ascent composition dove into the deep end. In an era where a single agent composition has dominated Ascent for years, a combination of Phoenix, Breach, and Viper is unheard of. In fact, in the entirety of the VLR database, LOUD's composition has never been used on any map before. The rolling barrage of flashes set up numerous quick site executes onto A. LOUD took short range map control at will. Unfortunately for them, Sacy arrived on the server hungry to make up for his early struggles. He notched a blazing 20 kills in the first half to pull SEN into the lead. Although Ascent has long been the most defensive map in the game, the lack of a sentinel again forced LOUD to be aggressive. Several mid crunches and flash heavy retakes overwhelmed a SEN squad that lost all momentum. LOUD rolled to a dominant 13-9 victory to take the series. Another day another rebuild for one of the top leaders in Valorant. Quick led the server with 39 kills in a close match with many hero plays on both sides. In the end, LOUD's dynamic style prevailed. LOUD move to the Group B winners match for a chance to qualify to the playoffs. SEN drop to the losers match where they will have to win twice in a row just to qualify to the play-in stage. SEN next play on Monday the 19th while LOUD play on Friday the 23rd. Banner image by Reece Martinez/Riot Games"

With these debut wins, NRG and Cloud9 now advance to face one another, with the winner of that future match qualifying to the playoff stage of the Americas Kickoff tournament. FURIA and MIBR remain alive in the tournament, and will face each other to see who keeps competing at the Kickoff. NRG prove their superteam title early on With the offseason over, these two matches were the first time players could see these modified rosters of well-respected teams. The new superteam version of NRG with Champions 2023 winners Ethan \" Ethan \" Arnold and Max \" Demon1 \" Mazanov debuted first, facing off against a team that also had a few changes heading into 2024: FURIA. Their big pickups included talent Ilan \" havoc \" Eloy, Vitor \" kon4n \" Hugo, and Felipe \" liazzi \" Galiazzi. The new map pool led to Breeze's debut, on the first map of the VCT Americas 2024 season. The compositions were the same, but everyone's eyes peered over to the Jett mirror. Demon1 started on fire, helping NRG hit the half up 8-4. Havoc's debut wasn't going well, ending the first half without a single kill. He managed to get two on round 14, to the cheer of the crowd, teasing him for a slow game so far. FURIA managed a bit of a comeback, but it ended 13-10 in NRG's favor. Map two, Ascent, looked to be a great opportunity for NRG to take the series quickly after winning on their opponent's map pick. FURIA started their first half strong, with havoc immediately outplaying his previous map. However, much like in map one, NRG turned up the heat in the second half, and Ethan proved his worth as a fragging IGL in his NRG debut. His play was key, but he was quick to praise the good timeouts from his new coach whenever his team got a little down. “We had some really good anti-strats from Chet ,” Ethan said post-match, “and that brought up the mood a bit.” As for his new role on the team, playing IGL for the first time in competitive play while joining a new roster, he didn't feel the pressure after the win. “This team makes it extremely easy, and I just do my job as a player.” Cloud9 squeak out close win off of OXY RgLM from MIBR. (Image via Riot Games) As for the matchup between Cloud9 and MIBR, the expectations were different. Cloud9 revamped their roster with some familiar faces, including Anthony \" vanity \" Malaspina and fellow Version1 teammate Maxim \" wippie \" Shepelev. As for MIBR, as the commentators said before the match, their highlight of VCT 2023 was getting Evil Geniuses into Masters Tokyo, being the domino for EG's championship that year. Aside from that, they were a bottom feeder, looking to improve with some new blood and a revamped coaching staff. To the delight of many fans, we got to see some new maps in the day, with C9 picking Bind and MIBR picking Split. With how the bans went, Lotus was the third map, meaning no map overlap with NRG and FURIA's game. Add onto that Francis \" OXY \" Hoang on Yoru, and Bind started off with a bang. The first half showed off the firepower of C9, but also the new coaching from MIBR, leading to a 7-5 lead for the Brazilian team. MIBR showed a lot of awareness to the tricks that C9 could pull with Yoru, not biting too hard to the constant fakes. Matheus \" RgLMeister \" Rodigoli stood out as a consistent player, in both utility and fragging. MIBR built up an 11-7 lead, but C9 fought back off of some good adaptations to MIBR's defense to clutch it up and win 13-11. In between maps, C9's new coach credited vanity for their ability to turn Bind around; a good sign heading into Split. Sticking with the double duelist, MIBR started Split off strong, winning pistols and converting their bonus as well. A defensive map proved to be easy for MIBR to take, taking C9 until round six to get their first round win. This also had the year's first professional ace , with OXY helping C9 turn the half from 0-5 to a 6-6 tie. The second half started well for MIBR again, winning pistols and bonus. That alone would be a big mountain to climb up, and C9 weren't able to make a comeback this time, losing Split 13-8. Map three brought another new agent debut for 2024, as vanity picked the Gekko. The double initiator Gekko and Fade for Lotus was interesting, but for the third time in a row, C9 lost both pistols and the bonus round. Cloud9 were able to recover from another slow start to end the half only down 5-7. Then, for the first time in their last four attempts, C9 won pistols due to a satisfying 4k from OXY. He then proceeded to get another ace, the second in VCT Americas 2024, proving this rookie performance as no fluke. It remained close, but Cloud9 rode the map to victory much like they did on Bind, winning 13-10. OXY's debut stats in VCT Americas. (Image via Riot Games) OXY was the star, and when asked about his feelings post-match, he was quick to point out how empty his head was as he aimed his way to two aces and a win. “I don't think much, I don't know,” OXY said post-match. “I play my matches like I play ranked, so that's why you see those clips.” As for what he's looking forward to, he quickly pointed out how he wanted to prove not only fans, but fellow competitors wrong. “ Demon1 called me the worst duelist in franchising, so we'll see about that.”"

Among the first batch of pros to try their hand at the title in 2020, xeta found some success within the Korean scene under Cloud9 Korea before the roster was dropped . A region change was in xeta's sights as he once again signed with Cloud9 in 2021, this time for their North American division. His time with the organization procured many highs, the most notable being a top-eight finish at Champions that year. After missing out on all international events of 2022, xeta departed C9 and signed with T1 ahead of the 2023 season.

In October, T1 competed in one OFF//SEASON event – the TEN Global Invitational – where xeta would play his last official matches with the team. A slew of roster changes would restructure the team ahead of 2024, leaving xeta on the bench as new talent was onboarded prior to his retirement. xeta took to Twitter and stated that after eight years of giving his all towards two separate game titles, the stress had stacked up and began affecting his mental health. He also cited his mandatory Korean National Service as one of the reasons for his departure, but expressed intentions to return to the competitive scene further down the line. The retirement of xeta still leaves T1 with their now-finalized roster ahead of the 2024 season. The team will debut in the Pacific Kickoff , which is set to begin on February 17. T1 is now: Lee \" Carpe \" Jae-hyeok (이재혁) Ha \" Sayaplayer \" Jeong-woo (하정우) Daniel \" Rossy \" Abedrabbo Ham \" iZu \" Woo-ju (함우주) Kevin \" xccurate \" Susanto Yoon \" Autumn \" Eu-ddeum (윤으뜸) (Head coach) Dakota \" Stunner \" MacLeod (Coach) Lee \" CheongGak \" Il-ho (이일호) (Coach)"

    "cleaned_content": "From grinding together in ranked to facing each other on stage, relationships begin and end at the top tier of Valorant. That is, unless your last name is Susanto, where at least one relationship makes its way back to the dinner table. Former pro CS:GO player Kevin \" xccurate \" Susanto joined T1 on Sept. 12, 2023, marking the second member of the Susanto family to make it to Valorant's top league. The first just happens to be one of the best players in the world, Paper Rex 's ever-flexible Jason \" f0rsakeN \" Susanto. Both had their histories in CS:GO before Valorant was released to the public, yet originally, the 25-year-old xccurate was the one to stand out at an international level with his time on TYLOO. He made a name for himself with the AWP, but was never able to reach the same heights after he left TYLOO. As for the 19-year-old f0rsakeN, he played competitive Counter-Strike because of his older brother, and stuck around the Asia-Pacific CS scene until Valorant's release. Then, he joined Paper Rex, and skyrocketed from a Yoru/Jett main to a key flex player on the second-best team in the world across 2023. Some people questioned his flexibility, but were quick to eat their words as he and his teammates finished Valorant Champions 2023 in second place. In a way, xccurate brought the Susanto name to light in CS, then f0rsakeN brought it to entirely new fans in Valorant. Both are standout players in their own right, but were never able to play with each other competitively. That isn't changing yet, but now xccurate will have to face off against f0rsakeN in Valorant, a game that might feel like a home turf advantage for his little brother. The break xccurate took from overall competitive play before joining T1 might leave some fans worried as to his ability, but he was quick to push that aside. “It feels really great to be back,” xccurate said to VLR, “and during my time off, I found the motivation to play again. I'm glad that T1 gave me this opportunity to prove myself once more to become the best player.” As for joining a different FPS game's esports scene, despite its similarities to CS:GO, xccurate is aware of his lack of experience in Valorant and his time away from the tournament grind, marking it as his biggest weakness heading into the 2024 season. “I think the thing that I have to improve on now is just getting the experience,” xccurate said. “I need to play more in offline or online tournaments, because it's been a long time that I haven't played in them. I have confidence in my team, and because I am new to this scene, I know that they can help me grow and give me a lot of feedback to improve myself.” xccurate with his T1 team in Korea. (Image via T1) In the 2023-24 offseason, xccurate has quickly proven that his sniper skills from CS have transferred over well. In fact, he did get to face his younger brother for the first time in Valorant in an offseason tournament, at the AfreecaTV Valorant League. While he lost the series, he outfragged his brother while proving in the two other matches that he could be a star player on a very intriguing T1 roster. But offseason tournaments are very different from the major league. T1 has a chance to face off against Paper Rex early on in 2024, depending on how the Pacific Kickoff event goes. They aren't in the same group, so they'd have to meet each other either in the play-ins or the playoffs. If that doesn't come around in late February, the teams will eventually face off, whether in Stage 1 or Stage 2 of their regional league. Both teams seem to be reaching for greatness, so the matchup likely will have some weight behind it aside from just two bros brawling it out. When that does eventually come around, xccurate knows exactly what he'll feel, having to compete against his brother for potentially high stakes, and couldn't help himself but make an anime reference. “If you watch the anime Naruto, it will be like Sasuke vs. Itachi,” xccurate said with a laugh. “But most importantly, I think it will be a great experience for me to play against them. It's going to be very interesting, just because I know that many people are waiting to see that happen.”"

The event will run from February 20 to March 1st as two teams aim to stamp their tickets to Masters: Madrid . Groups Similar to the recently-announced Pacific Kickoff, EMEA's event will feature 11 teams spread throughout three groups. Two-time major champions FNATIC will receive a BYE, most likely due to their performance last year. The three groups and their teams are as follows: Group A: FUT Esports Team Heretics GIANTX Karmine Corp Group B: Natus Vincere BBL Esports Team Liquid KOI Group C: Team Vitality Gentle Mates FNATIC Schedule Just like Pacific, EMEA's Kickoff will have three stages: Groups, Play-Ins, and Playoffs.

    "cleaned_content": "Riot has released information regarding the format and schedule of the VCT Pacific League. This year's schedule will vary from last as the league is divided up into three portions. Kickoff Pacific's league will commence on February 17 through the Pacific Kickoff . The event is divided into three phases, the first consisting of a three-group GSL format. The winners of each group will directly advance to the playoffs of Phase 3, while each second-place team must compete in a round robin format in Phase 2, where only one of the three teams can continue to the next phase. Each match up to the grand final will be Bo3, whereas the final two teams will play a Bo5. Three teams will bypass Phase 2 entirely and advance to the playoffs. (Image: Riot Games) Pacific Kickoff's Phase 1 groups are as follows: Group A: T1 BLEED ZETA DIVISION Global Esports Group B: DRX DetonatioN FocusMe Team Secret TALON Group C: Paper Rex Gen.G Rex Regum Qeon The conclusion of Kickoff will see the top two teams of Phase 3 advance to Masters: Madrid as the Pacific region's representatives. Spain's international LAN will commence on March 14. Stage 1 Shortly after the grand finals of Madrid on March 24, Stage 1 of the Pacific League will begin on April 4. The 11 teams will be split into two groups: Alpha and Omega. Five teams will be shuffled into the former, while the remaining six will slot into the latter. Throughout Stage 1, Alpha teams will fight against Omega teams in a single Bo3 round robin. The top three teams from each group will advance to a double-elimination bracket with the top team of each group receiving a BYE. The first two matches of playoffs will be elimination matches, meaning that the first two teams to lose will be unable to advance further in the bracket. Of the six teams at playoffs, only three will qualify for Masters. (Image: Riot Games) The top three teams of playoffs will punch their tickets to Masters: Shanghai, set to begin around the middle of May and end in June. Stage 2 Upon their return from China, the three teams will once again join the other eight in the Alpha and Omega groups. This time, however, there will be no matches outside of their respective groups; teams in the Alpha group will not play their Bo3 matches against those in the Omega group, and vice versa. The top six teams over the course of Stage 1 and 2 will qualify for the Pacific playoffs, where the top three teams qualify to Champions alongside a fourth additional representative determined by the highest Championship Points. One additional team will join the other three at Champions. (Image: Riot Games) Championship Points Championship Points are a newly-introduced feature and will be utilized to decide which teams will qualify for Champions at the end of the year. Different amounts of points are awarded depending on the event and placement. 2024 Championship Points Distribution: Kickoff: Final Win (+3) Masters 1: Final Win (+3) Stage 1: Match Win (+1), Final Win (+3) Masters 2: Final Win (+3) Stage 2: Match Win (+1) The goal of Championship Points is to reward teams who have been the most consistent throughout the year. While winning events such as Masters and Kickoff reward many points, teams should look to pick up as many match wins as possible throughout Stages 1 and 2 in order to ensure better odds of qualifying for Champions. Teams must remain in top form throughout their time within the League. (Image: Riot Games) Schedule The schedule for Kickoff's groups has been released by Riot and is as follows: Saturday, February 17 (Groups) 1:00 AM EST | 8:00 AM CEST | 3:00 PM KST - Group A Match 1: T1 vs. BLEED 3:00 AM EST | 10:00 AM CEST | 5:00 PM KST - Group C Match Match 3: Gen.G vs. Rex Regum Qeon 5:00 AM EST | 12:00 PM CEST | 7:00 PM KST - Group A Match 2: ZETA DIVISION vs. Global Esports Sunday, February 18 3:00 AM EST | 10:00 AM CEST | 5:00 PM KST - Group B Match 5: Team Secret vs. Talon Esports 5:00 AM EST | 12:00 PM CEST | 7:00 PM KST - Group B Match 4: DRX vs. Detonation FocusMe Monday, February 19 1:00 AM EST | 8:00 AM CEST | 3:00 PM KST - Paper Rex vs. TBD 3:00 AM EST | 10:00 AM CEST | 5:00 PM KST - TBD vs. TBD 5:00 AM EST | 12:00 PM CEST | 7:00 PM KST - TBD vs. TBD Tuesday, February 20 3:00 AM EST | 10:00 AM CEST | 5:00 PM KST - TBD vs. TBD 5:00 AM EST | 12:00 PM CEST | 7:00 PM KST - TBD vs. TBD Wednesday, February 21 1:00 AM EST | 8:00 AM CEST | 3:00 PM KST - TBD vs. TBD 3:00 AM EST | 10:00 AM CEST | 5:00 PM KST - TBD vs. TBD 5:00 AM EST | 12:00 PM CEST | 7:00 PM KST - TBD vs. TBD Saturday, February 24 (Semifinals) 3:00 AM EST | 10:00 AM CEST | 5:00 PM KST - TBD vs. TBD 5:00 AM EST | 12:00 PM CEST | 7:00 PM KST - TBD vs. TBD Sunday, February 25 (Grand Final) 3:00 AM EST | 10:00 AM CEST | 5:00 PM KST - TBD vs. TBD Coverage VLR.gg will be covering all of the VCT Leagues in our event hub .

The organization has less than two months to find a replacement before they fight for a chance at this year's Americas Ascension. The Controller player fought his way through last year's open qualifiers to secure a spot within 2023's Challengers League , and entered Split 1 alongside the rest of the then- BreakThru roster. A stellar performance sent the newly-acquired Moist Moguls to the Mid-Season Invitational, where they failed to achieve ideal results. However, the team turned things around in Split 2, where they finished first and secured a third-seed position at playoffs behind M80 and The Guard . Eager to prove themselves further at the 2023 Americas Ascension, Moist Moguls took down TSM and The Guard on their path to the grand final. One match away from qualifying for Brazil's international stage, the team fell to M80 in a shaky series. Unfortunately, an anticipated rematch against The Guard went the way of their opponents, and Moist Moguls were sent home from playoffs with a bronze medal. With their season over and a spot at next year's Challengers League secured, the Moguls joined forces with Shopify Rebellion Black and merged rosters. Joined by Xavier \" flyuh \" Carlson and brawk , thief rounded out the core of MxS and began preparing throughout the off season by participating in numerous tournaments. Although their results in OFF//SEASON events varied, MxS went head-to-head with many notable North American and partnered teams. Their best performance was at the LxT Invitational 2 , where the team upset Cloud9 and secured a second-place finish behind Oxygen Esports . Shorty after, the MxS announced that thief would no longer be on the roster moving forward. Head coach Jared \" mac \" Schneider took to Twitter/X and explained that thief's departure was due to the team looking for someone “with a different skill set.” The now-teamless player is current searching for a new home while MxS scour the scene for a potential replacement.

After two years of poor results, the organization finally turned their luck around in 2023. Despite exiting LOCK//IN with only one win, the remade squad fought hard in the Americas League and secured a spot at playoffs thanks to a five-way tiebreaker courtesy of MIBR . With three tickets to Masters: Tokyo on the line, the new villains of the VCT booked their trips to Japan alongside NRG and Brazilian juggernaut LOUD , where they finished second after being subdued by FNATIC , the first team to ever secure back-to-back international trophies. Having already qualified for Los Angeles' Champions , potter and the rest of her geniuses entered Group B prepared and advanced to the playoffs without dropping a map. After battling their way to the upper final, EG were stopped by a trophy-hungry Paper Rex , who sent them to the lower final after a three-map thriller.

    "cleaned_content": "BLEED and Disguised have confirmed an Affiliate Partnership for the upcoming season. The announcement means Disguised will now participate in the Malaysia/Singapore Challengers, as both teams must operate in the same region. First announced in October of last year, Affiliate Partnerships allow VCT partner teams to collaborate with a Challengers or Game Changers organization, enabling the use of Two-Way players and closer content collaboration. The Two-Way system allows the option for player substitutions while avoiding the possibility of a substitute playing one or two games in the year, as was the case for many in 2023. With this partnership, BLEED may designate players who have previous synergy with their main roster as Two-Way players, cushioning to an extent the issues that may arise from emergency substitutions. Notably, the new Disguised roster features ex-BLEED player Juicy , who helped the team win Ascension but was too young to participate in VCT Pacific . He is joined by former Ninjas In Pyjamas duo bryce and JayH , the latter also being an ex-BLEED player, as well as one of Egoist 's previous teammates, wayne . Disguised was previously participating in North America, with a Challengers and a Game Changers roster. They qualified for their respective main events in 2023, but were unable to advance to Ascension or the Game Changers Championship. Despite changing regions, Disguised will be able to take advantage of BLEED's previous ecosystem, as BLEED moves to Seoul to participate in VCT Pacific. BLEED is now the second VCT team to announce an Affiliate Partnership, after FNATIC confirmed their own collaboration with Mandatory ."

World champion Santeri \" BONECOLD \" Sassi has mutually terminated his contract with Team Vitality and is retiring from competitive play. This announcement comes nearly six months after his benching last July. Among the first five players to ever win Champions back in 2021, BONECOLD pivoted from purple to gold in 2022 as he departed Acend for Vitality. That year, he and the rest of the hornets took home a second-place finish at the Valorant Regional League: Finals following a reverse-sweep by FUT Esports . As Vitality restructured their roster prior to the 2023 season, BONECOLD and fellow teammate Jokūbas \" ceNder \" Labutis were all that remained as three new players were onboarded in hopes of reaching new heights. Unfortunately, the team only managed to win one match against Global Esports throughout their international debut at LOCK//IN before being sent home by LEVIATÁN . Returning home to compete in the EMEA League , BONECOLD and Vitality narrowly avoided early elimination and advanced to the playoffs with a 4-5 record. Eager to snatch tickets to Masters: Tokyo , Vitality attempted to battle their way to the top, but were eliminated by Team Liquid and FUT in two close series. Farewell, BONECOLD. (Photo: Lance Skundrich/Riot Games) Although the team was set to compete in the EMEA LCQ , they were given special permission by Riot to withdraw from the event following the passing of Karel \" Twisten \" Ašenbrener . Shortly after the end of their season, Vitality announced the benching of BONECOLD as the organization looked to restructure their roster ahead of 2024. As players shuffled in and out , BONECOLD remained on the bench until he and Vitality mutually agreed to terminate his contract. Shortly after his release from Vitality, BONECOLD announced on Twitter/X that he would no longer be pursuing a career in professional Valorant, citing that after a successful three years of competing, the arduous practice times and hours had begun to take a toll on him. BONECOLD is the first world champion to ever retire from competing. Vitality remains without a full roster ahead of the 2024 VCT.

    "cleaned_content": "FNATIC have become the first partnered VCT team to take advantage of the 2024 Affiliate Partnership system by announcing Mandatory as their Partnered Affiliate Team. Last year, Riot shared their vision for the upcoming season, which highlighted the company's strategy for Challengers Leagues heading into the 2024-2025 season. In their announcement, the concept of Affiliate Partnerships between teams was introduced. International teams would have the opportunity to build partnerships with Challenger and Game Changers teams, which in turn would unlock more opportunities to collaborate content and commercial partnerships. Affiliate partnerships with Challengers teams were region-locked, meaning that an organization competing in the EMEA League could only partner with an EMEA Challengers team, for example. However, Riot detailed that partnerships with Game Changers teams were not restricted to the region in which an organization was competing in. By participating in the Affiliate Partnership system, teams unlock the ability to utilize Two-Way Players. Players – such as a team's sixth man – who may not see as much playtime as their teammates may play in an Affiliate Partner Team's roster down in Challengers and Game Changers. Riot explained that this system helps give players “valuable competitive experience instead of being relegated to the bench.” FNATIC enter 2024 as EMEA's pride and joy after taking home the trophy in both São Paulo's LOCK//IN and Japan's Masters: Tokyo last year. Despite falling short at Champions with a fourth-place finish, the organization retains the same roster as last year, save for a vacant sixth-man spot previously occupied by Maks \" kamyk \" Rychlewski . Mandatory advanced all the way to the Play-Ins Playoffs of EMEA Ascension , where they were unfortunately denied access to the Group Stage following a fifth-place finish. Throughout their time within the French Challengers League , they played second fiddle to Gentle Mates , the eventual Ascension champions who secured their place within the 2024 EMEA League. Through their partnership with Mandatory, FNATIC have become the first VCT team to unlock the benefits of the Affiliate Partner system. As the season looms closer and closer, other organizations may choose to follow suit."

Huang \" Yuicaw \" Yung-chieh (黃湧傑) , Liu \" Spring \" Jiunting (刘俊霆) , Christopher \" pl1xx \" Li , Xiang \" coldfish \" Pengzhi (向鹏志) , Zhong \" balua \" Haojun (钟皓钧) , Deng \" Cyah \" Enping (邓恩平) , Leung \" FFs \" Cheuk Nam (梁卓南) , Geng \" Babyblue \" Haoran (耿浩然) , coaches Mingiyan \" Naint \" Goldaev and Xie \" jungleDSL \" Zhilin (谢志凛) all join the roster. Yuicaw is known for his time with the FunPlus Phoenix organization, first under academy team FunPlus Phoenix ZHUQUE in 2022, then the main team in 2023. After their international debut against Karmine Corp , FPX became a driving force for China – coming in the top four at both acts of the FGC Invitational and being the third Chinese seed for Champions . Following a 0-2 exit at Champions, Yuicaw left to join rivals Attacking Soul Esports , where they placed fourth in CN Evolution Series Act 2 and top six after a loss to FPX in Act 3 . Yuicaw's last showing for ASE was at Ascension , ending the year with a third-place finish. Spring began his career at Shenzhen NTER , one of the first teams to make a mark in the blooming Chinese scene in 2022. However, NTER could not carry over the same momentum in 2023. As such, Spring went on to Ninjas In Pyjamas , aiding their campaign for the CN Evo Series and a fourth-place finish at Ascension. pl1xx has been a staple for the OCE scene since beginning his career in 2020. After spending a year in North America with various teams – notably Soniqs and Andbox – he returned to Oceania in 2022. In 2023, pl1xx again went overseas, this time to China for Weibo Gaming , where they found marginal success but not enough for solid showings as they would get eliminated early on in all tournaments. After spending most of 2022 with Tales of Eastern , Coldfish hopped from team to team. First with TYLOO for FGC Invitational Act 1, getting eliminated in open qualifiers. A brief stint at Gank Gaming – where he played with future teammate Babyblue – resulted in a group stage exit for Act 2, then one game away from VCT China Champions Qualifier playoffs. Coldfish finally joined TOP Esports , finishing fourth in CN Evo Series Act 3. FFs, Cyah, and alulba made up the Monarch Effect core for 2023. ME had midding results, prone to exiting the open qualifiers early. Following a top twelve showing at Champions qualifiers and before CN Evo Series Act 3, the roster signed Babyblue, rejoining synergy with alulba and FFs from O2 Gaming . Monarch Effect played in the play-ins group stage and went out 0-2. Little is known about Wolves Esports except for two quick losses in open qualifiers for the Evolution series. Due to their reputation in Rainbow Six eSports and as the owners of Premier League team Wolverhampton Wanderers, Wolves were accepted as one of 11 teams for the upcoming VCT China League. With a roster this large, any combination of players can happen. The starting roster seems to point to Yuicaw, Spring, pl1xx, Coldfish, and alulba, with the rest on the bench.

(Photo by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games) Joining as in-game leader is sword9 , recently an assistant coach for EDward Gaming . Originally an initiator player, he joined EDG as staff ahead of their Masters Tokyo qualification campaign. As a player he is best known for his time on KONE eSports Club , where, alongside Knight and yosemite , he managed to reach fourth place in the 2022 East Asia LCQ . Indonesian player deLb joins as their import and likely duelist. He spent most of his career on Alter Ego , but joined 17Gaming in the tail end of 2023 for their Ascension bid. They went out in groups, but deLb still boasted the fourth-highest ACS of the tournament. The final pickup is Spitfires , formerly Rare Atom 's substitute player. He was a part of their original lineup back in February 2023, but was eventually replaced by yoman entirely. Despite being one of the first Chinese organizations to sign a Valorant roster, All Gamers have never been successful, failing to place in the top four in any event. Most recently, they featured miKa and BeYN , loaned from DRX Academy , but the team was unable to make it past the China Evolution play-in stage .

    "cleaned_content": "Riot has announced the VCT Kickoff format, which will be consistent across the four regions, as well as the way Championship Points will be distributed throughout the year. Kickoff will be this year's way to start the year. Instead of a big international tournament like LOCK//IN , Riot has opted for one tournament per region. Each region's Kickoff Tournament will be split into three stages: groups, play-ins, and playoffs. The eleven teams will be seeded into three groups, one of which will have just three teams. Each region's best squad — their highest placed team at Champions — will be put into that group, which will be played in a modified GSL bracket. The seeding details are not clear — they are “based on 2023 performance” — but it is safe to assume FNATIC (#1) and Gentle Mates (#11) may be in Group 3, the latter due to being VCT newcomers. The remaining eight teams will be split into two four-team groups played in a regular GSL format. While the winners of each group will move straight to the playoffs, the second-placed teams will face off in the play-ins in a single round-robin. The winner will round out the playoffs stage as the fourth team. The playoffs of Kickoff will be a single-elimination bracket, with both finalists heading to Masters Madrid . The winner will also receive preferential seeding in Spain. Image by Riot Games Championship Points will be distributed this year, but will work differently from 2021 and 2022's VCT Points. Winning any tournament — Kickoff, Masters Madrid, Masters Shanghai, Stage 1 Playoffs, or Stage 2 Playoffs — will earn a team three points. Any match win (across 10 matches per team) across Stage 1 and 2 will also award a team with one point. The top three teams at the end of Stage 2 will receive a berth at Champions 2024. Each region will also take a fourth team to the world championship, who will earn their spot via Championship Points. Riot has also dropped a hint regarding each Stage's playoffs: the first and second seed in each Stage will receive a bye to the second round, earning an extra point to compensate for the match they will skip. VCT Americas will open the 2024 season, as competition will begin Feb. 16. A day later, the Pacific region will begin its own kickoff tournament. VCT EMEA begins a few days later, on Feb. 20, and China will be the latest starter, scheduled to start Feb. 22. Masters Madrid will occupy the month of March, with Stage 1 kicking off in early April. Dates for Masters Shanghai, Stage 2, and Valorant Champions 2024 are yet to be revealed. Image by Riot Games"

Against all odds, DRG upset Rare Atom in the grand final 3-1 and claimed their rightful spot in the Chinese League. The transfer of nizhaoTZH is one of the many roster changes expected to shake up the Chinese scene ahead of Kickoff as organizations look to finalize their squads.

The duo will join German prospects Click , Felix , and murii as the troupe prepares to compete in the 2024 DACH Challengers League. Rounding out the roster are the tenured coaches of joYnt and yaotziN. , with joYnt acting as the brains of the operation for SK. Meddo spent the early stages of Valorant playing for big names such as FunPlus Phoenix , Giants Gaming , and most notably G2, with whom he secured a top six finish at 2022's Masters Reykjavik . After departing the organization prior to 2023, Meddo played in multiple Challengers Leagues for different teams like The Barbers and HSDIRR , maintaining a presence in Tier 2 through multiple Challengers League appearances preluding his signing with SK. Bati was part of the former Arroz squad that was later signed by SAW . The organization found success within the 2023 Portugal Challengers League and qualified for EMEA Ascension , where they battled their way through team after team to book their tickets to playoffs. Three wins away from an invite to the 2024 EMEA League, SAW had their dreams crushed after suffering back-to-back losses at the hands of Apeks and eventual-champions Gentle Mates . Click, Felix, and murii all shared time on Wave Esports for nearly two years before going their separate ways. Despite all playing under different teams at the time, the trio still secured appearances at multiple events in EMEA's T2 scene, with murii even earning himself a brief appearance at Ascension alongside MOUZ . The inception of the SK roster began in October of 2023, when joYnt was tasked with building the roster from scratch. The organization's Head Coach was no stranger to leading notable teams in the past, with a history of coaching different rosters for Entropiq , LDN UTD , and Guild GC . Now, three months later, he has finished reuniting a strong DACH core joined by a storied player and Portuguese import. The first roster of SK Gaming, pending Riot approval, is set to debut in the upcoming DACH Challengers League , which commences on Saturday, Jan 13.

AsLanM4shadoW leaves BBL after 1268 days together. When AsLanM4shadoW joined BBL, the budding Turkish roster was still fighting for their presence in Europe, while simultaneously dominating regional competition. That became the standard for BBL, who only solidified their spot in EMEA in 2022, with that year's format changes and with 2023's kickoff of the partnered era. During the time leading up to the partnered era, AsLanM4shadoW survived numerous rebuilds. He was the only player from BBL's founding roster to reach the partnered VCT EMEA, and the most tenured member in the squad by over a year at that time; QutionerX was the second-most tenured member, having joined in December 2021. In AsLanM4shadoW's final year under BBL, the roster entered VCT EMEA as one of two Turkish representatives (alongside FUT Esports ). The team struggled to make a mark in 2023, bowing out of LOCK//IN in the first round to DRX and, some months later, finishing the EMEA regular season one victory shy of playoffs contention. In the LCQ , AsLanM4shadoW & co. were eliminated early in their opening match by Karmine Corp . AsLanM4shadoW is the first player BBL let go since September, when the team dropped three of its players.

    "cleaned_content": "The first patch of 2024 has arrived, introducing Episode 8 Act 1. To kick off the new year, Riot have added a new gun, Outlaw, as well as announced a new map rotation, Icebox and Lotus updates, as well as Deadlock and Killjoy changes. To debut Episode 8, Riot have also released two videos. Yesterday, the Episode 8 cinematic which shines some light on Omen lore. Today, the day of the patch, a gameplay video which showcases the new Outlaw weapon, as well as some of the Act 1 skins. The full patch notes have been reproduced below. Images of the Icebox and Lotus changes are available on Riot's blog post . GENERAL UPDATES The Gun Buddy Carousel should now appear alphabetical by name. Hopefully, it is much easier to find what you want! AGENT UPDATES Deadlock Continuing in the direction of the previous 7.10 GravNet (C) changes, we're looking to build upon the unique strengths of Deadlock's two other basic abilities: Sonic Sensor (Q) and Barrier Mesh (E). For Sonic Sensor (Q), we're increasing the reliability of the concuss once triggered by shortening its windup time, while also increasing flexibility by allowing you to recall and redeploy it in round. Sonic Sensor (Q) Sonic Sensors are now recallable in round. Sonic Sensor's pickup distance increased 12m >>> 27m Decreased time to concuss once triggered 1.0s >>> 0.5s Decreased time for enemies to destroy Sonic Sensor once triggered 0.65s >>> 0.5s Deadlock and her allies can now hear Sonic Sensor's audio lightly when they are in its area of effect. For Barrier Mesh (E), we increased the max length of the barrier walls to allow it to divide much larger spaces than is possible with comparable utility and make it more reliable at fully blocking chokes when deployed quickly. Barrier Mesh (E) Increased the max length Barrier Mesh walls 6m >>> 10m Killjoy The amount of coverage on Killjoy's Turret (E) outshines other defensive recon tools when paired with the Turret's other strengths, such as its autonomous detection and long range vision. Reducing its vision cone should push Killjoy to make clearer choices about what area of the map her Turret will cover, while the Turret's updated visuals should aid you in quickly understanding what areas it will protect. Turret (E) Vision radius reduced 180 degrees >>> 100 degrees Added a representation of the Turret's vision cone on Killjoy's minimap when she is placing the Turret. Added VFX and updated the Turret's animations to communicate the Turret's new vision radius. MAP UPDATES Doors Refactor We have upgraded the tech behind our interactable doors in order to polish some of your interactions with others and with Agent abilities. Icebox Icebox is back with a few changes to shake up Mid, B Green and B Orange. Our goal with these changes is to add value and impact to Mid for either team controlling it and simplify pathing toward B Site through B Orange and B Green to make fights more predictable. Attacker Side Spawn Storage container has been added on the left side to block line of sight from Attacker Spawn to B Tube. B Green The hanging container in B Green was creating a lot of complexity for both fights on the ground and people boosting up top. Moving the container out of the way should make combat here more manageable. B Tube Exterior We felt that Mid could use more value for either team holding it. We've added a window toward the end of B Tube that overlooks Mid and can see towards A Site and Defender Spawn. It allows Attackers to assert a lot of pressure on rotators and Defenders should be able to hold more space when holding Mid from B Kitchen or Mid Boiler. B Tube Interior Added two boxes stacked flush to the wall B Snow Pile There were multiple parallel paths leading from Mid to B Site. To reduce timings and create more predictable fights we've removed the B Orange route closest to B Kitchen. Adjusted the snowpile leading up to B Kitchen so you can now silently drop off the boxes. Lotus Attackers have felt fairly overwhelming to Defenders on Lotus. Because of this, we're adding more options by adjusting neutral spaces and making some quality of life updates across the map so that Defenders can better hold sites. A Main More room has been added to A Main along with a set of boxes to give Defenders some more options to fight for A Rubble control. The double stack of boxes outside A Stairs has been changed to non-penetrable to reduce the likelihood of being spammed. A Link More room has been added near the breakable door. It was always a little awkward to fight out of the broken door, but now it should be easier to fight out from inside the connector room. A Hut A Hut has been closed to help give some more readability to the plant site, making it easier to retake. A cubby has also been added to the back of A Hut for more defender options to hold the site. B Site More room and boxes have been added to B Site to add some defensibility closer to the choke on site. C Site The Spike plant zone and the stairs in C Bend have been adjusted to allow for more diversity of Spike plant locations in C Site. Boxes on the back of site have been adjusted. C Bend More room and boxes have been added in C Main to also add some defensibility closer to the front of Main. Boxes have been added to C Bend along with some extra room to fight from. Rotating Doors Rotating doors now take 10 seconds to fully complete their spin, up from 8 previously. 8 seconds was not enough time to use utility through the doors or fight, and make it through the doors on the same rotation. The extra time should allow for more fights to happen through the doors, and most everyone to get through the door on time. Increased the time it takes for rotating doors to complete their rotation 8s >>> 10s MODES UPDATE Team Deathmatch We felt that the Sheriff is overperforming in the Stage 2 weapon ecosystem and, as a result, other loadouts have been pushed to the side. This change aims to allow other weapons to be more viable when in an engagement against a Sheriff. Stage 2 - Sheriff Loadout Heavy Shield >>> Light Shield Map Rotation All modes (except Team Deathmatch and Custom games) will use the Competitive map rotation. Current rotation: Icebox, Lotus, Sunset, Breeze, Ascent, Bind, Split Premier Updates Team Captain Role We've added a secondary management role to rosters called Team Captain. Team Captains can help with team management including inviting and removing team members. Captains cannot delete the team or kick the Team Owner out. Team Owners can promote and demote a Team Captain. Standings You can now view standings in other divisions and for previous Stages of Premier using the drop down menus on the top left of the Standings Tab. Divisions You can now see which division you are seeded into before you play your first match. Playoff Qualification The threshold to qualify for this Stage is back to the standard 675 Premier Score. EMEA Zone Updates We've updated our Zones to support the VCT Challengers League Path to Promotion in EMEA. To learn more about how to qualify for Challengers Open Qualifiers and how Premier integrates into esports in 2024, check out this article.~ WEAPONS UPDATES The Outlaw goes live! Learn about our newest weapon on our Arsenal page . GAMEPLAY SYSTEMS UPDATES Starting in Patch 8.0, VALORANT will support third party spatialization software for headphones. Spatial Audio is virtual surround sound for headphones. This software processes sound to help you differentiate sounds that are in front, behind, or even above you, while listening on headphones. For example, figuring out if those footsteps were in front of you or behind you. We are excited to announce that Patch 8.0 will include official support for 3rd party spatial audio solutions! This gives you choices beyond the HRTF option which was already available in VALORANT's audio settings. In Patch 7.06, we made changes to the audio engine that caused issues for those of you who were already using third party spatialization software, which we did not support at the time. When 3rd party spatialization software was active in Windows settings in 7.06, sound levels went haywire and our only solution at the time was to guide those being affected to turn third party spatialization software off for the time being. We implemented a stereo-only fix in 7.07 that was compatible with Spatial Audio, but did not allow it to virtualize surround sound. In Patch 8.0, the Speaker Configuration in VALORANT's audio settings will default to stereo, but you can enjoy all of the features that these spatial audio solutions provide if you choose to opt in by setting the Speaker Configuration to Auto-Detect. How can I experience Spatial Audio in VALORANT? Step 1: Open VALORANT's audio settings and change the Speaker Configuration from Stereo to Auto-Detect. Step 2: Turn on Spatial Audio in your Windows settings. Open the Sound control panel, right click your playback device, choose Properties, and go to the Spatial sound tab. This is where you can turn spatialization software on and select different spatial sound formats. Riot have also left a FAQ in the patch notes regarding spatial audio support, which can be found here . BUG FIXES General Fixed a bug with Raw Input Buffer where swapped primary/secondary mouse keys in Windows mouse settings was not being respected. KNOWN ISSUES Team Deathmatch When the Outlaw is picked up from a weapon spawner, it does not have reserve ammunition. We are currently working on a fix."

After two years of lackluster results with Evil Geniuses, Boostio and the rest of his team began to turn things around in 2023. Despite an early exit from LOCK//IN at the hands of TALON , the roster narrowly advanced to the playoffs of the Americas League and claimed a spot at Masters: Tokyo following a risky roster change. Following their return to the international stage, EG tore through the competition and defeated team after team without dropping a map. However, the villains were eventually subdued by fan-favorites FNATIC in the upper and grand finals of the event, sending EG home with a second-place finish. Having already qualified for Los Angeles' Champions , EG once again took the stage by storm as they handled FunPlus Phoenix and FUT Esports in the group stage. Although they managed to reach the upper final without much resistance, the roster was once again sent to the lower bracket, this time by Paper Rex . After a five-map series took both EG and LOUD the distance, North America's last hope emerged victorious and continued their villainous run in the grand finals, where they flipped the script and defeated Paper Rex 3-1 to give North America its first-ever Champions trophy. A spectacular conclusion to an amazing storyline. (Photo: Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games) Following their win in L.A. and amid the roster shuffles preluding 2024, EG saw the departure of Ethan \" Ethan \" Arnold and Max \" Demon1 \" Mazanov to NRG before Boostio followed suit with 100T. Despite starting off 2023 with a strong top eight finish at LOCK//IN, 100 Thieves were unable to outdo their previous results. The team was denied a spot at the Americas League playoffs after a knife in the back from MIBR forced them into an unfavorable tiebreaker. With one last chance at making Champions in the form of the Americas LCQ , 100T took Pearl from Sentinels in their opening match, but could not close out the series and were eliminated from contention, effectively ending their year. Shortly after, the organization released two players and brought on Daniel \" eeiu \" Vucenovic from M80 while making changes to their coaching staff. Boostio's acquisition completes the roster ahead of the 2024 VCT as the thieves look to make off with a title this time around. 100 Thieves are now: Kelden \" Boostio \" Pupello Sean \" bang \" Bezerra Matthew \" Cryocells \" Panganiban Daniel \" eeiu \" Vucenovic Peter \" Asuna \" Mazuryk Anthony \" Zikz \" Gray (Head coach) Michael \" Mikes \" Hockom (Assistant coach)"

Prior to the commencement of 2023's LOCK//IN , he found himself signing with Leviatán amidst the roster shuffles following franchising. The roster performed fairly well in Brazil, and took home a top eight finish after falling to semifinalists Natus Vincere . Eager to surpass their previous results in the Americas League , the team advanced to the playoffs, but were sent home winless after suffering losses to FURIA and Cloud9 . Forced to fight in the Americas LCQ for a ticket to Champions, nzr and the rest of Leviatán fell to KRÜ Esports in their opening match and were sent to the lower bracket. After dispatching of Sentinels , Leviatán eliminated Cloud9 in a five-map thriller to secure a grand finals appearance with KRÜ. Unfortunately, the team could not stop the Cinderella run that KRÜ had embarked on, and their 2023 chapter was cut short by the very team that went winless in the Americas League. A series of roster changes ensued as Shyy and Tacolilla were swapped out for aspas and tex . The new iteration of Leviatán enacted their revenge on KRÜ in their opening match of Superdome, and went on to defeat Cloud9 and FURIA to win the event without dropping a map.
